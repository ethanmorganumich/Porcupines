What do I need to know about abstract algebra to understand blockchain?

There is no one answer to this question as it depends on the individual's level of abstraction and knowledge about abstract algebra. However, some basic concepts that may be helpful include:

- Abstract algebra is a branch of mathematics that deals with the structure and properties of mathematical objects, such as groups, rings, and algebras.
- In blockchain, abstract algebra is used to model the relationships between different blocks in a blockchain network.
- Abstract algebra can also be used to describe the behavior of blockchain networks in terms of data structures and algorithms.
