Jodhpurs
||||||
Jodhpurs, in their modern form, are tight-fitting trousers to the ankle, where they end in a snug cuff, and are worn primarily for horse riding. The term is also used as slang for a type of short riding boot, also called a paddock boot or a jodhpur boot, because they are worn with jodhpurs.  According to Mayer, "Jodhpurs â€¦ exemplify the material and cultural exchanges between Britain and its Indian colony in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries."
Originally, jodhpurs were snug-fitting from just below the knee to the ankle, and were flared at the hip to allow ease for sitting in the saddle. Modern jodhpurs are made with stretch fabric and are tight fitting throughout. They are supportive and flexible.
