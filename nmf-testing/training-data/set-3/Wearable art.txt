Wearable art

Wearable art, also known as Artwear or "art to wear", refers to art pieces in the shape of clothing or jewellery pieces.: 12  These pieces are usually handmade, and are produced only once or as a very limited series. While the making of any article of clothing or other wearable object typically involves aesthetic considerations, the term wearable art implies that the work is intended to be accepted as an artistic creation or statement. Wearable art is meant to draw attention while it is being displayed, modeled or used in performances. Pieces may be sold and exhibited. 
Wearable art sits at the crossroads of craft, fashion and art.: 12  The modern idea of wearable art seems to have surfaced more than once in various forms. Jewellery historians identify a wearable art movement spanning roughly the years 1930 to 1960. Textile and costume historians identify wearable art as a heir to the 1850s Arts and Crafts movement, which burgeoned in the 1960s.

It grew in importance in the 1970s, fueled by hippie and mod subcultures. The term wearable art itself emerged around 1975 to distinguish it from body art, and was used alongside Artwear and Art to Wear coined by Julie Schafler Dale.: 22  Probably the most notorious pieces are from Viktor and Rolf as found in their fall couture show from 2015. Carefully handmade clothing was considered as a device for self-articulation and furthermore, a strategy to defy large-scale manufacturing. The optimistic start of the movement that considered pieces of clothing to be a type of self-articulation today has developed into a new and fresh style of garments. Supporting that it is a type of art, most delivered pieces are shown and sold through galleries, shops, and specialist fairs. The yearly World of Wearable Art awards held since 1987 in Nelson in New Zealand, moving in 2005 to Wellington requiring a bigger scene for the occasion is a significant happening that grandstands the astonishing abilities of the creators. For a few, the examination concerning various textures is the final product and regularly materials pass on the pieces, while for others the greater and more lavish a dress or another garment is, the better. Most wearable art is made of fibrous materials and constitutes therefore a branch of the wider field of fiber art, which includes both wearable and non-wearable forms of art using fabric and other fiber products. Wearable art as an artistic domain can also include jewelry, or clothing made from non-fiber materials such as leather, plastic sheeting, metals, etc.
