Plattenbau
||||||
Plattenbau (plural: Plattenbauten, German: Platte + Bau, lit.â€‰'panel/slab' + 'building/ construction') is a building constructed of large, prefabricated concrete slabs. The word is a compound of Platte (in this context: panel) and Bau (building). Such buildings are often found in housing development areas.
Although Plattenbauten are often considered to be typical of East Germany, the prefabricated construction method was used extensively in West Germany and elsewhere, particularly in public housing (see tower block). In English the building method is also called large panel system-building, shortened "LPS".
