Berg house

The Berg house (German: Bergisches Haus, also Bergischer Dreiklang or Bergische Bauweise) is a type of timber framed house that is widespread in the German region of Bergisches Land. Typical of its timber framed post construction are the green window shutters (Schlagläden in the local dialect), white door lintels and window frames combined with black frame work and white plaster infill, as well as grey-black slate façades and/or rubble stone plinth. A stone staircase often leads to the front door.
The slate façade serves to protect the infill or nogging against the weather and was either applied on the side facing the prevailing wind or on all four sides, depending on the status and wealth of the owner. The slates bear witness to the regional relationship of the houses with the geological unit of the Rhenish Massif, known as the Rhenish Slate Mountains (Rheinisches Schiefergebirge).
On the farmhouse variant (by contrast with the otherwise identical, but slightly larger small town variant), the green timber framed door, with its stable door design (separate upper and lower door), is another feature of the Berg house.
