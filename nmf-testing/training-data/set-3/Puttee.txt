Puttee
||||||
A puttee (also spelled puttie, adapted from the Hindi paṭṭī, meaning "bandage") is a covering for the lower part of the leg from the ankle to the knee, alternatively known as: legwraps, leg bindings, winingas, or Wickelbänder. They consist of a long narrow piece of cloth wound tightly, and spirally round the leg, and serving to provide both support (as a compression garment) and protection.  They were worn by both mounted and dismounted soldiers, generally taking the place of the leather or cloth gaiter.
