Cargo pants

Cargo pants or cargo trousers, also sometimes called combat pants or combat trousers after their original purpose as military workwear, are loosely cut pants originally designed for rough work environments and outdoor activities, distinguished by numerous large utility pockets for carrying tools.
Cargo shorts are a shorts version of the cargo pants, with the legs usually extending down to near-knee lengths.
Both cargo pants and shorts have since become also popular as an urban casual wear, since they are loose-fitting and quite convenient for carrying extra items during everyday foot trips or while cycling.
