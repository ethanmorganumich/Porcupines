Territorial Revival architecture describes the style of architecture developed in the U.S. state of New Mexico in the 1930s.  It derived from Territorial Style, an original style which had developed in the 19th century and before, in the wider region of Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico (since the founding of Albuquerque in 1706) and the New Mexico Territory (until 1912).  Territorial Revival incorporated elements of traditional regional building techniques with higher style elements. The style was intended to recall the Territorial Style and was extensively employed for New Mexico state government buildings in Santa Fe.
The style was encouraged by a State Planning Board proclamation of 1934, which advocated the redesign of the state capitol in "the local Santa Fe type of architecture." Architect John Gaw Meem, a leading proponent of the related Pueblo Revival architectural movement, is considered to be the initiator of Territorial Revival architecture.
