Jodhpur boot
||||||
The Jodhpur boot is an ankle boot or Chelsea boot designed as a riding boot with a rounded toe and a low heel. They originally fastened with a strap and buckle, but today the term also includes designs with straps that do not wrap entirely around the ankle and the elastic-sided design without a strap also known as Chelsea boots.  A closely related riding boot design is called a paddock boot, particularly if modified to have a lace-up front. It is named after Jodhpur,  the second-largest city in the Indian state of Rajasthan.
