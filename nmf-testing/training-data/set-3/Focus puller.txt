Focus puller
||||||
A focus puller or first assistant camera (1st AC) is a member of a film crew's camera department whose primary responsibility is to maintain the camera lens's optical focus on whatever subject or action is being filmed.
"Pulling focus" refers to the act of changing the camera lens's focus distance to a moving subject's distance from the focal plane, or the changing distance between a stationary object and a moving camera. For example, if an actor moves from 8 m to 3 m away from the focal plane within a shot, the focus puller will change the distance setting on the lens in precise relation to the changing position of the actor. Additionally, the focus puller may shift focus from one subject to another within the frame, as dictated by the requirements of the shot. This process is called "rack focusing".
