Pendhapa
||||||
A pendhapa or pandhapa (Javanese: ꦥꦼꦤ꧀ꦝꦥ or ꦥꦤ꧀ꦝꦥ, Indonesian spelling: pendapa, nonstandard spelling: pendopo) is a fundamental  element of Javanese architecture unique in the southern central part of Java; a large pavilion-like structure built on columns. Either square or rectangular in plan, it is open on all sides and provides shelter from the sun and rain, but allows breeze and indirect light. The word pendhapa is cognate to the Sanskrit word mandapa ("hall").The Dutch writer Multatuli in his colonial reformist novel Max Havelaar described the pendhapa thus: "After a broad-brimmed hat, an umbrella, or a hollow tree, a 'pendoppo' [sic] is certainly the most simple representation of the idea 'roof'."Derived from ancient Javanese architectural elements, pendhapa are common ritual spaces primarily intended for ceremony, and also for a purposes such as receiving guests in the compounds of wealthy Javanese, and even as cottage industry work spaces. Pendhapa are constructed as a stand-alone structure or, attached to a walled inner structure (dalem), may form the front part of a traditional Javanese house (omah).
