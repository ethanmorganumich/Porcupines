Orchestra pit
||||||
An orchestra pit is the area in a theater (usually located in a lowered area in front of the stage) in which musicians perform.  Orchestral pits are utilized in forms of theatre that require music (such as opera and ballet) or in cases when incidental music is required.  The conductor is typically positioned at the front of the orchestral pit facing the stage.
