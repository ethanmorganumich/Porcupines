Bead crochet is a crochet technique that incorporates beads into a crochet fabric.  The technique is used to produce decorative effects in women's fashion accessories.  The word "crochet" is derived from the French "croche" or "croc" meaning "to hook". Published descriptions of bead crochet date from around 1824 although it was probably common before then.  At one time, bead crochet was thought by some people to be appropriate only for rich people.Early examples of bead crochet include nineteenth century miser's purses.  By the 1920s bead crochet technique also made necklace ropes, bracelets, and beaded bags.  Bead crochet waned during the 1930s when the great depression reduced free time for decorative needlework and as inexpensive manufactured goods became more readily available.  Interest in bead crochet has revived somewhat in recent years as a hobbyist pastime.
