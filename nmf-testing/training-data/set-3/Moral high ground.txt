Moral high ground
||||||
The moral high ground, in ethical or political parlance, refers to the status of being respected for remaining moral, and adhering to and upholding a universally recognized standard of justice or goodness. In derogatory context, the term is often used to metaphorically describe a position of self-righteousness.

"Parties seeking the moral high ground simply refuse to act in ways which are not viewed as legitimate and morally defensible."
