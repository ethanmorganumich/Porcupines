Chinese postman problem
||||||
In graph theory, a branch of mathematics and computer science, Guan's route problem, the Chinese postman problem, postman tour  or route inspection problem is to find a shortest closed path or circuit that visits every edge of an (connected) undirected graph. When the graph has an Eulerian circuit (a closed walk that covers every edge once), that circuit is an optimal solution. Otherwise, the optimization problem is to find the smallest number of graph edges to duplicate (or the subset of edges with the minimum possible total weight) so that the resulting multigraph does have an Eulerian circuit. It can be solved in polynomial time.The problem was originally studied by the Chinese mathematician Kwan Mei-Ko in 1960, whose Chinese paper was translated into English in 1962. The original name "Chinese postman problem" was coined in his honor; different sources credit the coinage either to Alan J. Goldman or Jack Edmonds, both of whom were at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards at the time.A generalization is to choose any set T of evenly many vertices that are to be joined by an edge set in the graph whose odd-degree vertices are precisely those of T.  Such a set is called a T-join.  This problem, the T-join problem, is also solvable in polynomial time by the same approach that solves the postman problem.
