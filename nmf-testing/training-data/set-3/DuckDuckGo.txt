DuckDuckGo
||||||
DuckDuckGo (DDG) is an internet search engine that emphasizes protecting searchers' privacy and avoiding the filter bubble of personalized search results. DuckDuckGo does not show search results from content farms. It uses various APIs of other websites to show quick results to queries and for traditional links it uses the help of its partners (mainly Bing) and its own crawler. Because of its anonymity, it is impossible to know how many people use DuckDuckGo.The company is based in Paoli, Pennsylvania, in Greater Philadelphia and had 200 employees as of November 2022. The company name is a reference to the children's game duck, duck, goose.
