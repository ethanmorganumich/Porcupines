A differential amplifier is a type of electronic amplifier that amplifies the difference between two input voltages but suppresses any voltage common to the two inputs. It is an analog circuit with two inputs 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            in
          
          
            −
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{\text{in}}^{-}}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            in
          
          
            +
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{\text{in}}^{+}}
   and one output 
  
    
      
        
          V
          
            out
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{\text{out}}}
  , in which the output is ideally proportional to the difference between the two voltages:

  
    
      
        
          V
          
            out
          
        
        =
        A
        (
        
          V
          
            in
          
          
            +
          
        
        −
        
          V
          
            in
          
          
            −
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle V_{\text{out}}=A(V_{\text{in}}^{+}-V_{\text{in}}^{-}),}
  where 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   is the gain of the amplifier.
Single amplifiers are usually implemented by either adding the appropriate feedback resistors to a standard op-amp, or with a dedicated integrated circuit containing internal feedback resistors. It is also a common sub-component of larger integrated circuits handling analog signals.
