Prow house
||||||
Prow house is an American term for a house with a projecting front portion that resembles the prow of a ship. The T-shaped layout contrasts more traditional designs where the front of the structure is more parallel with the street. The style and name originated in Arkansas in the nineteenth century, and contemporary versions are used particularly to accentuate views from within the house in scenic areas.
