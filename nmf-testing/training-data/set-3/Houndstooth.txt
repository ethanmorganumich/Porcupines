Houndstooth
||||||
Houndstooth, hounds tooth check or hound's tooth (and similar spellings), also known as dogstooth, dogtooth, dog's tooth, (French: pied-de-poule, lit. 'hen's foot'), (Chinese: 千鸟格; pinyin: qiānniǎo gé; lit. 'thousand-bird pattern'), is a duotone textile pattern characterized by broken checks or abstract four-pointed shapes, traditionally in black and white or such contrasting dark and light pattern, although other colour combinations are also often applied. 
The classic houndstooth pattern is an example of a tessellation.
A smaller-scale version of the pattern can be referred to as puppytooth.
