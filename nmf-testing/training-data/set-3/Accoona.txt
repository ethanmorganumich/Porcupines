Accoona
||||||
Accoona was an internet company with offices in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Shanghai, China.  Their main product was a search engine that claimed to use artificial intelligence to better understand searches. On June 23, 2005, in the ABC Times Square Studios, the AI Accoona Toolbar, driven by a Fritz 9 prototype, played against the chess grandmaster Rustam Kasimdzhanov. In addition to traditional searches, it allows business profile searches, and its signature "SuperTarget" feature.  Their exclusive partnership with China Daily, a large Chinese internet portal, was seen as a highly strategic move.
The CEO of Accoona was Valentine J. Zammit, formerly of 24/7 Real Media and DoubleClick.
After IPO problems, Accoona shut down on October 5, 2008.In October 2008 the web page said: "Dear Accoona search users, Due to an overwhelmingly competitive search market, Accoona.com and Accoona.cn will no longer be active.  We thank you for your previous support. Sincerely, Accoona Management."
Accoona's domains and search facilities were acquired by Masterseek B2B (business-to-business) search engine on October 30, 2008.
