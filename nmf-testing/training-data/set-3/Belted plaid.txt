||||||
The belted plaid (or a plaid worn belted) is a large blanket-like piece of fabric which is wrapped around the body with the material pleated or, more accurately, loosely gathered and secured at the waist by means of a belt. Typically, a portion of the belted plaid hangs down to about the knees (for men) or ankles (for women) with the rest of the material being wrapped up around the upper body in a variety of ways and pinned or otherwise secured to keep it in place.
The belted plaid was a standard item of men's Highland dress from the late 16th century until the middle of the 18th century, It was also found in Ireland up until the early 16th century. It was also the precursor of the modern tailored kilt.
