List of Rosa species
||||||
There is significant disagreement over the number of true rose species. Some species are so similar that they could easily be considered variations of a single species, while other species show enough variation that they could easily be considered to be different species. Lists of rose species usually show more than 320.  The numbers 320 to 350 are the figures accepted by most botanists, but as Bailey has pointed out the extreme lumpers Bentham and Hooker only allowed for thirty species, while the extreme splitter  Michel Gandoger allowed 4266 species just in Europe and western Asia.
