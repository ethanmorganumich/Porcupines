Arsis and thesis
||||||
In music and prosody, arsis (; plural arses, ) and thesis (; plural theses, ) are respectively the stronger and weaker parts of a musical measure or poetic foot. However, because of contradictions in the original definitions, writers use these words in different ways. In music, arsis is an unaccented note (upbeat), while the thesis is the downbeat. However, in discussions of Latin and modern poetry the word arsis is generally used to mean the stressed syllable of the foot, that is, the ictus.Since the words are used in contradictory ways, the authority on Greek metre Martin West recommends abandoning them and using substitutes such as ictus for the downbeat when discussing ancient poetry. However, the use of the word ictus itself is very controversial.
