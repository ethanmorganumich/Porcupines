Head covering for Jewish women
||||||
According to halacha (Jewish law), married Jewish women are expected to cover their hair when in the presence of men other than their husband or close family members. Such covering is common practice nowadays among Orthodox Jewish women.
Different kinds of head coverings are used, among them the mitpaá¸¥at or tichel (headscarf), shpitzel, snood, hat, beret, and sheitel (wig). The most common head coverings in the Haredi community are headscarves in the form of the tichel and snood, though some wear hats, berets or sheitels; the tichel and snood remain the historic and universally accepted rabbinical standard for observant Jewish women. The headscarves can be tied in a number of ways, depending on how casually the wearer is dressed.
Covering the hair is part of the modesty-related dress standard called tzniut.
