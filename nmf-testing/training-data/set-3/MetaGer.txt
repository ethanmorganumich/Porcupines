MetaGer
||||||
MetaGer is a metasearch engine focused on protecting users' privacy. Based in Germany,
and hosted as a cooperation between the German NGO 'SUMA-EV - Association for Free Access to Knowledge' and the University of Hannover,
the system is built on 24 small-scale web crawlers under MetaGer's own control.
In September 2013, MetaGer launched MetaGer.net, an English-language version of their search engine.
