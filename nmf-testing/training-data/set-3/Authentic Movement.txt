Authentic Movement
||||||
Authentic Movement grew out of an inner-directed approach to movement developed by Mary Starks Whitehouse that was described as unpremeditated, genuine, or “authentic.” Mary called her work “Movement-in-depth.”   Janet Adler developed this approach into a practice involving a mover and a witness.
