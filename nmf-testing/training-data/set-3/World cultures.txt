Cultural area
||||||
In anthropology and geography, a cultural region, cultural sphere, cultural area or culture area refers  to a geography with one relatively homogeneous human activity or complex of activities (culture).  Such activities are often associated with an ethnolinguistic group and with the territory it inhabits.  Specific cultures often do not limit their geographic coverage to the borders of a nation state, or to smaller subdivisions of a state. Cultural "spheres of influence" may also overlap or form concentric structures of macrocultures encompassing smaller local cultures.  Different boundaries may also be drawn depending on the particular aspect of interest, such as religion and folklore vs. dress and architecture vs. language.
