A kitharode (Latinized citharode)
(Ancient Greek: κιθαρῳδός [kitʰarɔː'dós] and κιτηαρῳδός; Latin: citharoedus) or citharist,
was a classical Greek professional performer (singer) of the cithara, as one who used the cithara to accompany their singing. Famous citharodes included Terpander, Sappho, and Arion.
"Citharoedus" or "Citharede" was also an epithet of Apollo (Apollo Citharede), and the term is used to refer to statues which portray Apollo with his lyre.
