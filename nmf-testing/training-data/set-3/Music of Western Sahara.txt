Music of Western Sahara
||||||
The Western Sahara has an established music tradition. Many of the well-known from the country musicians have settled in Dakar, where they mingled further with musicians from West Africa.
Sahrawi music shares much in common with neighbouring musical traditions such as those of Mauritania and southern Morocco, yet retain aspects of pre-colonial heritage. The Tbal is the basic instrument of percussion, though the traditional string instrument called Tidinit, has largely been replaced by electric guitar.
The first Sahrawi music LP, titled Polisario vencer√°, was recorded live in Barcelona, in 1982 by the band Shahid El Uali.
Some performers are tribespeople who have lived a nomadic existence, which is true of Mariem Hassan.From 1998, Nubenegra (Spanish music label) marketed several Sahrawi music CDs in the United States and Germany, with a first release of  a three-disc box set from 1998 titled Sahrauis: The Music of the Western Sahara (catalogue number INT 32552).
