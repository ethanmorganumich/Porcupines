Colonial buildings and structures in Jakarta include those that were constructed during the Dutch colonial period of Indonesia. The period (and the subsequent style) succeeded the earlier period when Jakarta (known then as Jayakarta/Jacatra), governed by the Sultanate of Banten, were completely eradicated and replaced with a walled city of Batavia. The dominant styles of the colonial period can be divided into three periods: the Dutch Golden Age (17th to late 18th century), the transitional style period (late 18th century â€“ 19th century), and Dutch modernism (20th century). Dutch colonial architecture in Jakarta is apparent in buildings such as houses or villas, churches, civic buildings, and offices, mostly concentrated in the administrative city of Central Jakarta and West Jakarta.
Below is a list of colonial buildings and structures found in Jakarta. The list is sorted alphabetically according to its official (local) name. The list can also be sorted to each category.
Buildings that were renovated in a manner that significantly changed their appearance are listed separately to distinguish the different architectural form.
Some notable Chinese-style buildings and Islamic mosques that were built during these period are included in the list for comparison.
