Robe de style
||||||
The robe de style describes a style of dress popular in the 1920s as an alternative to the straight-cut chemise dress.
The style was characterised by its full skirts. The bodice could be fitted, or straight-cut in the chemise manner, with a dropped waist, but it was the full skirt that denoted the robe de style. Sometimes the fullness was supported with petticoats, panniers, or hoops.
The robe de style was a signature design of the couturier Jeanne Lanvin. Other couture houses known for their versions of the robe de style included Bou√© Soeurs, Callot Soeurs, Doeuillet and Lucile.
