Nano House
||||||
The Nano House was named to be the world's smallest sustainable house. 
The Nano Living System is a Swiss made "green" pre-engineered concept for residential use that presents an innovative and sustainable architectural proposition. The design was based on a combination of pre-engineered SIPs (made from cement fiberboard, recycled light gauge steel and polyurethane foam), creation of flexible spaces and use of renewable energy systems.
The Nano House can be used by a family of three in an area consisting of 25 square metres (270 sq ft). This is made possible by the incorporation of the "suspending technology", which nearly doubles the size of the living area within this space by transforming what is common living space by day into two separate bedrooms by night. The "suspending technology" can be used in new construction and can also be adapted to be used in existing structures, such as hotels, studios, dormitories and very small housing.
