Music and politics
||||||
The connection between music and politics, particularly political expression in song, has been seen in many cultures.  Music can express anti-establishment or protest themes, including anti-war songs, but pro-establishment ideas are also represented, for example, in national anthems, patriotic songs, and political campaigns. Many of these types of songs could be described as topical songs.
