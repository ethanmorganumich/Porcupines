Singspiel
||||||
A Singspiel (German pronunciation: [ˈzɪŋʃpiːl] (listen); plural: Singspiele; lit. 'sing-play') is a form of German-language music drama, now regarded as a genre of opera. It is characterized by spoken dialogue, which is alternated with ensembles, songs, ballads, and arias which were often strophic, or folk-like. Singspiel plots are generally comic or romantic in nature, and frequently include elements of magic, fantastical creatures, and comically exaggerated characterizations of good and evil.
