Voter fatigue
||||||
In political science, voter fatigue is a cause of voter apathy which results from the electorates of representative democracies being required to vote too often.  Voter fatigue and voter apathy should be distinguished from what arises when voters are not allowed or unable to vote, or when disenfranchisement occurs, or voters are engaged generally but repelled by the options available.
