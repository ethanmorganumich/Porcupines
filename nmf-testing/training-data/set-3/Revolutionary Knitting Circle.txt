Revolutionary Knitting Circle
||||||
A Revolutionary Knitting Circle is an activist group that uses craftivism (specifically knitting and other textile handicrafts) in its efforts to bring about social change.
The first Revolutionary Knitting Circle group was founded in Calgary, Canada, by Grant Neufeld in 2000. Since then, groups have formed across Canada, in the United States, and various parts of Europe.
