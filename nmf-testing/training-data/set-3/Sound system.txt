Their recording contract with Real World was for five albums, of which Volume 5: Anatomic was the last.After a number of festival dates in 2007, the band went on hiatus. In 2010, they regrouped to play a number of shows (including a return to WOMAD), releasing a re-mastered retrospective titled Capture.On 20 May 2014, Afro Celt Sound System announced the release of the album Born.
