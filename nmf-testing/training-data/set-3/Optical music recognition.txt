Optical music recognition
||||||
Optical music recognition (OMR) is a field of research that investigates how to computationally read musical notation in documents. The goal of OMR is to teach the computer to read and interpret sheet music and produce a machine-readable version of the written music score. Once captured digitally, the music can be saved in commonly used file formats, e.g. MIDI (for playback) and MusicXML (for page layout).
In the past it has, misleadingly, also been called "music optical character recognition". Due to significant differences, this term should no longer be used.
