Globrix
||||||
Globrix was a UK real estate search engine that was launched in January 2008. It was launched as a joint venture with News International, publishers of The Sunday Times, The Sun, The Times, The News of the World and Thelondonpaper.Estate agents and letting agents could list their properties for free. This competed with traditional paid-listings sites such as Rightmove (originally a joint venture between four of the UK's largest property agents, now a public limited company), Propertyfinder (also partly backed by News International) and Primelocation (owned by Daily Mail and General Trust). Unlike most property websites, Globrix directed users to agent websites rather than hosting the property details and capturing the lead on Globrix itself. Globrix gathered its property listings in three different ways; crawling agent websites, taking data feeds and by agents manually uploading via the Globrix extranet. Because Globrix was 'free to list', Globrix was able to gain substantial market coverage and claimed to list more properties than any other UK property website. Unlike websites like Gumtree and Oodle, private sellers and landlords were not allowed to list their properties on the site.
The website charged property professionals and property related services companies for geo-targeted banner ads. There were also premium services available to estate and letting agents (such as Search Engine Optimization consultancy, branded email alerts and increased traffic) and Google Ads were displayed in unsold advertising positions on the right hand side of search results.
