Khalaj people

The Khalaj (Bactrian χαλασσ Xalass; Pashto: خلجیان, romanized: Khalajyān; Persian: خلج‌ها, romanized: Xalajhâ) are a Turkic ethnic group who mainly live in Iran. Medieval Muslim scholars considered the tribe to be one of the earliest to cross the Amu Darya from Central Asia into present-day Afghanistan. The Khalaj were described as sheep-grazing nomads in Ghazni, Qalati Ghilji, and the surrounding districts, who had a habit of wandering through seasonal pastures.
In Iran, they still speak Khalaj language although most of them are Persianized. In Afghanistan, the Ghilji tribe of Pashtuns very likely descends from the Khalaj people.
