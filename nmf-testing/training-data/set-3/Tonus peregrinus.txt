Tonus peregrinus
||||||
Tonus peregrinus, the wandering tone, or the ninth tone, is a reciting tone in Gregorian chant.
The chant example here is not identified as the tonus peregrinus in the Liber usualis (see LU, pp. 760â€“761), although it is in Aeolian mode. For the tonus peregrinus in its customary usage for Psalm 113, see LU p. 160.
