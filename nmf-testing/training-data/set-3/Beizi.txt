Beizi (Chinese: 褙子; pinyin: bèizi), also known as beizi (Chinese: 背子; pinyin: bēizi) and chuozi (Chinese: 绰子; pinyin: chuòzi), is an item worn in traditional Chinese attire common to both men and women; it is typically a large loose outer coat with loose and long sleeves. It was most popular during the Song Dynasty, Ming Dynasty, and from the early Qing to the Mid-Qing dynasty. The beizi originated in the Song dynasty. In the Ming dynasty, the beizi was referred as pifeng (Chinese: 披风; pinyin: pī fēng). When worn by men, it is sometimes referred as changyi (Chinese: 氅衣), hechang (Chinese: 鹤氅; pinyin: hèchǎng; lit. 'crane cloak'), or dachang (Chinese: 大氅) when it features large sleeves and knotted ties at the front as a garment closure.
