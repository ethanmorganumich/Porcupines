Malaysian batik
||||||
Malaysian batik is batik textile art in Malaysia, especially on the east coast of Malaysia (Kelantan, Terengganu and Pahang). The most popular motifs are leaves and flowers. Malaysian batik depicting humans or animals are rare because Islam norms forbid animal images as decoration. However, the butterfly theme is a common exception. Malaysian batik is also famous for its geometrical designs, such as spirals. The method of Malaysian batik making is also quite different from those of Indonesian Javanese batik, the pattern is larger and simpler, it seldom or never uses canting to create intricate patterns and relies heavily on brush painting method to apply colours on fabrics. The colours also tend to be lighter and more vibrant than the deep coloured Javanese batik.
In line with the Malaysia concept, the Malaysian government is now endorsing Malaysian batik as a national dress to every level of the general population, by having local designers create new batik designs which reflect the Malaysia idea.In Malaysia, batik is also considered a cultural icon, with "Malaysian Batik Day" (in Malay:	Hari Batik Malaysia) celebrated every year on 3rd December. Many Malaysians continue to wear Malaysian batik every day for both casual and formal events.
