Bench trial
||||||
A bench trial is a trial by judge, as opposed to a trial by jury.  The term applies most appropriately to any  administrative hearing in relation to a summary offense to distinguish the type of trial. Many legal systems (Roman, Islamic) use bench trials for most or all cases or for certain types of cases.
While a jury renders a verdict, a judge in a bench trial does the same by making a finding.
