Balconet
||||||
Balconet or balconette is an architectural term to describe a false balcony, or railing at the outer plane of a window-opening reaching to the floor, and having, when the window is open, the appearance of a balcony. They are common in France, Portugal, Spain, and Italy. They are often referred to as Juliet balconies after the scene from Shakespeare's play Romeo and Juliet.
A prominent example of a balconette is on the Palazzo Labia in Venice.
