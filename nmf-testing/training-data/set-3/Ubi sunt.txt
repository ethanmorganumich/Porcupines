Ubi sunt
||||||
Ubi sunt (literally "where are... [they]") is a rhetorical question taken from the Latin Ubi sunt qui ante nos fuerunt?, meaning "Where are those who were before us?" Ubi nunc...? ("Where now?") is a common variant.Sometimes interpreted to indicate nostalgia, the ubi sunt motif is actually a meditation on mortality and life's transience.
Ubi sunt is a phrase which originally derived from a passage in the book of Baruch (3:16â€“19) in the Vulgate Latin Bible  beginning Ubi sunt principes gentium? "Where are the princes of the nations?" It became commonplace in medieval literature.
