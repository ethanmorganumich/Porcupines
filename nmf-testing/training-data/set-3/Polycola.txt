PolyCola, previously known as GahooYoogle, is a metasearch engine ( search engine that searches multiple search engines at once) which was created by Arbel Hakopian.
It was started with the domain www.GahooYoogle.com in 2005. When it was first known to the public, it was discussed in BBC radio, was chosen at HotSite by USA Today and managed to have entries in Fox News Channel. However, the site was shut down due to legal problems. GahooYoogle.com had a legal problem, so after the shut down, the site was moved to Yahoo! with the order made by the court after being an issue for couple of years.
After the shut down, the creator, Arbel Hakopian, decided to expand his original idea of GahooYoogle.com and came up with the idea of PolyCola.com; currently it is operating with the address www.polycola.com. The new and improved PolyCola.com lets searchers to minimize the time and problem they might have in using multiple search engines.
