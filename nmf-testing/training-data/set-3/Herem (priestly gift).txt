Herem (priestly gift)
||||||
In the Tanakh, the term herem (Hebrew חֵרֶם ḥêrem) is used, among other meanings, for an object or real property to be devoted to God, with God authorizing a kohen (Jewish priest) to be its receiving agent.This law is one of the twenty-four kohanic gifts and, of those twenty-four, as one of ten gifts given to the priest even outside the land of Israel.According to Abba Jose ben Hanan, the nuances of the herem laws (as well as laws of hekdesh and arakhin, and five other categories of laws) are considered "eight pillars of Torah law" that are "principles of Halakha".
