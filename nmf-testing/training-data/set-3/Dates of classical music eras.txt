Dates of classical music eras
||||||
Music historians divide the Western classical music repertory into various eras based on what style was most popular as taste changed.  These eras and styles include Medieval, Renaissance,   Baroque, Classical, Romantic, Modernist, and Postmodernist.  The 20th and 21st centuries are not musical eras in themselves, but are calendar periods that do not relate individually to musical history. However, these two calendar centuries can be combined into a longer musical period that includes the Modernist and Postmodernist eras.  Some of the terms, such as "Renaissance" and "Baroque", are borrowed from Western art history. Approximate dates can be assigned to the beginning and ending of each of these eras, which can be  useful in describing changes in taste and to estimate the style of a work composed in a particular year.  However, these dates are approximate and even good approximations are hard to make.
