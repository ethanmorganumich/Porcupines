Jumpsuit
||||||
A jumpsuit is a one-piece garment with sleeves and legs and typically without integral coverings for feet, hands or head. The original jump suit is the functional one-piece garment used by parachuters. 
The original skydivers' jumpsuits were simple garments designed to insulate the body from the colder temperature that's associated with higher altitudes and minimize the risk of covering important handles and grips. Today, however, the garment has found other uses.
Jumpsuits are generally regarded as a garment of convenience, especially for entertainers, as they are simpler, lighter and more flexible to wear.  They have become  more of a put on and remove garment than an ensemble outfit.   However, unless the jumpsuit has an opening on the rear (a "drop seat"), it is necessary to remove it entirely for bathroom use.
