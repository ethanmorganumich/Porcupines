Dance position is a position of a dancer or a mutual position of a dance couple assumed during a dance. Describing and mastering proper dance positions is an important part of dance technique.
These dance positions of a single dancer may be further detailed into body, head, arm, hand, leg, and foot positions; also, these positions in a dance couple can additionally take into account connection, the relative orientation of partners, and directions of movement (or of movement intention).
In ballet, the term "pose" is used to describe stationary dance positions; the most important are referred to as "first position" through to "fifth position." The following includes descriptions of all major ballet positions.
