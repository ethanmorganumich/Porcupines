Polychotomy
||||||
A polychotomy (päl′i kät′ə mē; plural polychotomies) is a division or separation into many parts or classes. Polychotomy is a generalization of dichotomy, which is a polychotomy of exactly two parts.  In evolutionary biology, the term polychotomy can also be considered a historically-based misspelling of polytomy.
