Architecture of Puerto Rico
||||||
The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of architectural styles and built forms over the country's history of over four centuries of former Spanish rule, and over a century of American rule. Puerto Rico's architecture is as diverse as its multicultural society and has been shaped by many internal and external factors and regional distinctions.
