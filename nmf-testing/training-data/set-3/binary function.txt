Binary function
||||||
In mathematics, a binary function (also called bivariate function, or function of two variables) is a function that takes two inputs.
Precisely stated, a function 
  
    
      
        f
      
    
    {\displaystyle f}
   is binary if there exists sets 
  
    
      
        X
        ,
        Y
        ,
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle X,Y,Z}
   such that

  
    
      
        
        f
        :
        X
        ×
        Y
        →
        Z
      
    
    {\displaystyle \,f\colon X\times Y\rightarrow Z}
  where 
  
    
      
        X
        ×
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle X\times Y}
   is the Cartesian product of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y.}
