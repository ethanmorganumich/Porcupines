The name was originally given by censor Gaius Maenius in 318 BC to the decorated gallery in the Colosseum, where spectators watched gladiatorial combats.The maenianum was divided into several levels: maenianum primum, which was reserved for the non-senatorial noble class called the equites. The maenianum secundum, which featured the better, lower seats for the wealthy plebeians; and maenianum summum with the upper seats for the poor plebeians.
