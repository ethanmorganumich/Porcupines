Loggia

In architecture, a loggia ( LOH-j(ee-)ə, usually UK:  LOJ-(ee-)ə, Italian: [ˈlɔddʒa]) is a covered exterior gallery or corridor, usually on an upper level, but sometimes on the ground level of a building. The outer wall is open to the elements, usually supported by a series of columns or arches.  They can be on principal fronts and/or sides of a building and are not meant for entrance but as an outdoor sitting room. An overhanging loggia may be supported by a baldresca.From the early Middle Ages, nearly every Italian comune had an open arched loggia in its main square, which served as a "symbol of communal justice and government and as a stage for civic ceremony".
