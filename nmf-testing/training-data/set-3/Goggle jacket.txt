Goggle jacket
||||||
Goggle jackets are a hooded windproof type jacket released in 1988 made by C.P. Company for the sponsoring of Mille Miglia and open car endurance race and became popular across Europe and in Britain. They zip up to cover the head and face completely, except for two built-in goggles, sometimes covered with transparent mesh or various lenses and sometimes including a mesh mouth area for ease of breathing.
Some people wear them to protect their faces against cold and driven rain, some for concealment.
