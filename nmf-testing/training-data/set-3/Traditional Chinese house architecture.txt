Traditional Chinese house architecture
||||||
Traditional Chinese house architecture refers to a historical series of architecture styles and design elements that were commonly utilised in the building of civilian homes during the imperial era of ancient China. Throughout this two-thousand year long period, significant innovations and variations of homes existed, but house design generally incorporated a set of qualities that made Chinese home architecture distinct from that of other cultures and regions. As highlighted by the classic siheyuan style, this included an emphasis on extended family units in a single dwelling, distinct separation of various elements of the household, alignment with the cardinal directions and wooden construction; all in line with Confucian hierarchy and Feng Shui.
