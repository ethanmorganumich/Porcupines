Solomonic column
||||||
The Solomonic column, also called Barley-sugar column, is a helical column, characterized by a spiraling twisting shaft like a corkscrew. It is not associated with a specific classical order, although most examples have Corinthian or Composite capitals.  But it may be crowned with any design, for example, making a Roman Doric solomonic or Ionic solomonic column.
