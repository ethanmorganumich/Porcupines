In probability and statistics, the Yule–Simon distribution is a discrete probability distribution named after Udny Yule and Herbert A. Simon.  Simon originally called it the Yule distribution.The probability mass function (pmf) of the Yule–Simon (ρ) distribution is

  
    
      
        f
        (
        k
        ;
        ρ
        )
        =
        ρ
        B
        ⁡
        (
        k
        ,
        ρ
        +
        1
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(k;\rho )=\rho \operatorname {B} (k,\rho +1),}
  for integer 
  
    
      
        k
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle k\geq 1}
   and real 
  
    
      
        ρ
        >
        0
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho >0}
  , where 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle \operatorname {B} }
   is the beta function.  Equivalently the pmf can be written in terms of the rising factorial as

  
    
      
        f
        (
        k
        ;
        ρ
        )
        =
        
          
            
              ρ
              Γ
              (
              ρ
              +
              1
              )
            
            
              (
              k
              +
              ρ
              
                )
                
                  
                    
                      ρ
                      +
                      1
                    
                    _
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(k;\rho )={\frac {\rho \Gamma (\rho +1)}{(k+\rho )^{\underline {\rho +1}}}},}
  where 
  
    
      
        Γ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Gamma }
   is the gamma function.  Thus, if 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   is an integer,

  
    
      
        f
        (
        k
        ;
        ρ
        )
        =
        
          
            
              ρ
              
              ρ
              !
              
              (
              k
              −
              1
              )
              !
            
            
              (
              k
              +
              ρ
              )
              !
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(k;\rho )={\frac {\rho \,\rho !\,(k-1)!}{(k+\rho )!}}.}
  The parameter 
  
    
      
        ρ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \rho }
   can be estimated using a fixed point algorithm.The probability mass function f has the property that for sufficiently large k we have

  
    
      
        f
        (
        k
        ;
        ρ
        )
        ≈
        
          
            
              ρ
              Γ
              (
              ρ
              +
              1
              )
            
            
              k
              
                ρ
                +
                1
              
            
          
        
        ∝
        
          
            1
            
              k
              
                ρ
                +
                1
              
            
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(k;\rho )\approx {\frac {\rho \Gamma (\rho +1)}{k^{\rho +1}}}\propto {\frac {1}{k^{\rho +1}}}.}
  
This means that the tail of the Yule–Simon distribution is a realization of Zipf's law: 
  
    
      
        f
        (
        k
        ;
        ρ
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle f(k;\rho )}
   can be used to model, for example, the relative frequency of the 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
  th most frequent word in a large collection of text, which according to Zipf's law is inversely proportional to a (typically small) power of 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
