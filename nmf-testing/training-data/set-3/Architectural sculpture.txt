Architectural sculpture
||||||
Architectural sculpture is the use of sculptural techniques by an architect and/or sculptor in the design of a building, bridge, mausoleum or other such project. The sculpture is usually integrated with the structure, but freestanding works that are part of the original design are also considered to be architectural sculpture.  The concept overlaps with, or is a subset of, monumental sculpture.
It has also been defined as "an integral part of a building or sculpture created especially to decorate or embellish an architectural structure."Architectural sculpture has been employed by builders throughout history, and in virtually every continent on earth save pre-colonial Australia.
