A rage aria is an operatic aria expressing the rage of the character performing it.

Rage arias were known by various terms in Italian, including aria di strepito, aria agitata and aria infuriata. Typically, they display the musical characteristics of quick tempos and fast runs, and are short in length. Such arias have been written by, amongst other composers, George Frideric Handel in the Baroque period and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in the Classical period.
