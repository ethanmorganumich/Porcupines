Bobby soxer (music)
||||||
Bobby soxer is a dated term for the wildly enthusiastic, adolescent female fans of 1940s traditional pop music, in particular that of singer Frank Sinatra. Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls in high schools and colleges, who got their name from the popular bobby socks that they wore. As a teenager, actress Shirley Temple played a stereotypical bobby soxer in the film The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer (1947).The presence of bobby soxers signaled a shift in American youth culture. Businesses and corporations noticed that they were able to profit off the burgeoning consumer power of teenagers — especially among girls — and began targeting products to younger buyers, creating a new subset of American culture. Teenagers became more prominent in society as they participated in activities such as dancing and going to the movies. Music and dancing grew more popular among teenagers in the 1940s; the most popular types of music were swing and jazz, which were favored by bobby soxers. The increased popularity of music made it a big part of the lives of bobby soxers, as they frequently discussed their favorite musicians with each other and bonded over records.
