Mahalo.com was a web directory (or human search engine) and Internet-based knowledge exchange (Question-and-answer website) launched in May 2007 by Jason Calacanis. It differentiated itself from algorithmic search engines like Google and Ask.com, as well as other directory sites like DMOZ and Yahoo! by tracking and building hand-crafted result sets for many of the currently popular search terms. President Jason Rapp exited the company in September, 2012.In 2014, Calacanis announced that Mahalo would enter server sunset as he moved his focus towards an app called Inside. He was quoted by TechCrunch saying "it makes 7 figures so weâ€™re not shutting it off but we are not investing in it". Mahalo's website has since shut down.
