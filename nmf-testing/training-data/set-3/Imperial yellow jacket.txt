Imperial yellow jacket
||||||
The imperial yellow jacket (simplified Chinese: 黃马褂; traditional Chinese: 黃馬褂; pinyin: Huáng mǎguà) was a symbol of high honour during China's Qing dynasty. As yellow was a forbidden color, representing the Emperor, the jacket was given only to high-ranking officials and to the Emperor's body guards.
