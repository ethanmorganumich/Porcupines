Tas-de-charge
||||||
In architecture, tas-de-charge is a French language term for which there is no equivalent in English, given to the lower courses of ribs of a Gothic vault, which are laid in horizontal courses and bonded into the wall, forming a solid mass. This helps bond the ribs, vault and walls together. They generally rise about one-third of the height of the vault, and as they project forwards they lessen the span to be vaulted over.
