Rebuttable presumption
||||||
In common law and civil law, a rebuttable presumption (in Latin, praesumptio iuris tantum) is an assumption made by a court that is taken to be true unless someone proves otherwise. For example, a defendant in a criminal case is presumed innocent until proven guilty. It is often associated with prima facie evidence.
