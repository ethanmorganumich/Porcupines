Hypergraph

In mathematics, a hypergraph is a generalization of a graph in which an edge can join any number of vertices. In contrast, in an ordinary graph, an edge connects exactly two vertices.
Formally, an undirected hypergraph 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
   is a pair 
  
    
      
        H
        =
        (
        X
        ,
        E
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle H=(X,E)}
   where 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is a set of elements called nodes or vertices, and 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is a set of non-empty subsets of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   called hyperedges or edges. Therefore, 
  
    
      
        E
      
    
    {\displaystyle E}
   is a subset of 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
        (
        X
        )
        ∖
        {
        ∅
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(X)\setminus \{\emptyset \}}
  , where 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
          
        
        (
        X
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {P}}(X)}
   is the power set of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  . The size of the vertex set is called the order of the hypergraph, and the size of edges set is the size of the hypergraph.
A directed hypergraph differs in that its hyperedges are not sets, but ordered pairs of subsets of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  , with each pair's first and second entries constituting the tail and head of the hyperedge respectively.
While graph edges connect only 2 nodes, hyperedges connect an arbitrary number of nodes. However, it is often desirable to study hypergraphs where all hyperedges have the same cardinality; a k-uniform hypergraph is a hypergraph such that all its hyperedges have size k. (In other words, one such hypergraph is a collection of sets, each such set a hyperedge connecting k nodes.) So a 2-uniform hypergraph is a graph, a 3-uniform hypergraph is a collection of unordered triples, and so on. An undirected hypergraph is also called a set system or a family of sets drawn from the universal set.
Hypergraphs can be viewed as incidence structures.  In particular, there is a bipartite "incidence graph" or "Levi graph" corresponding to every hypergraph, and conversely, most, but not all, bipartite graphs can be regarded as incidence graphs of hypergraphs.
Hypergraphs have many other names.  In computational geometry, an undirected hypergraph may sometimes be called a range space and then the hyperedges are called ranges.
In cooperative game theory, hypergraphs are called simple games (voting games); this notion is applied to solve problems in social choice theory.  In some literature edges are referred to as hyperlinks or connectors.The collection of hypergraphs is a category with hypergraph homomorphisms as morphisms.
