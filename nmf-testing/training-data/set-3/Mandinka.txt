The Mandinka (or Manding, Mandingue, Mandingo) are a West African ethnolinguistic people present mainly in Mali, Guinea, Senegal, Gambia, Ivory coast, Ghana and Guinea-Bissau. The Mandinka are also present to a lesser extent in Sierra Leone and far north of Liberia, where they are very much in the minority. In terms of population, the Mandinka are estimated to number over 11 million. Etymologically speaking the term “Mandinka” or “Manding” is a deformation of the word mandenka, that is to say "inhabitant of Manden” (-ka being the suffix meaning "inhabitant"), the historic centre of the Mali Empire. The term Malinké of Fulani origin is synonymous with Manding. The Mandinka or Manding are in several sub-groups as to which the Malinke gave birth to the Bambara, Dioula, Diakhanke and the Malinke themselves who constitute towards the Mandinka people. The Mandinka who speak Manding Languages are the largest subgroup of the Mande speaking peoples, which is one of the largest language groups in Africa. Over 99% of the Mandinka adhere to Islam. Their largest urban centre is Bamako, the capital of Mali.The Mandinka are the descendants of the Mali Empire, which rose to power in the 13th century under the rule of Mansa Sundiata Keita, who founded an empire that would go on to span a large part of West Africa. They migrated west from the Niger River in search of better agricultural lands and more opportunities for conquest. Nowadays, the Mandinka inhabit the West Sudanian savanna region extending from The Gambia and the Casamance region in Senegal to Ivory Coast. Although widespread, the Mandinka constitute the largest ethnic group only in the countries of Mali, Guinea and The Gambia. Most Mandinka live in family-related compounds in traditional rural villages. Their traditional society has featured socially stratified castes.: 43–44  Mandinka communities have been fairly autonomous and self-ruled, being led by a chief and group of elders. Mandinka has been an oral society, where mythologies, history and knowledge are verbally transmitted from one generation to the next. Their music and literary traditions are preserved by a caste of griots, known locally as jelis, as well as guilds and brotherhoods like the donso (hunters).The Soninkes established the Empire of Ghana, or Wagadou, from the 3rd century. Between the 11th century and the 12th century, the Keita clan unified the Mandinka tribes located in Manden. Then at the beginning of the 13th century, they built the Empire of Mali under the direction of Sundjata Keïta which frees them from the domination of the Kingdom of Sosso (another Mandinka Kingdom) of Soumaoro Kanté and proclaims the Charter of Manden. The Mandinka constituted many kingdoms and Empires which lasted until the end of the 19th century with European colonization, among the best known:

The Bambara kingdoms of Ségou and Kaarta, Mali.
The Kaabu, between Senegal and Guinea-Bissau.
The Sosso Empire, between Mauritania and Mali.
Kabadougou, North Ivory Coast.
The Khasso, in the west of Mali.
The Niani, extreme eastern Guinea, on the west bank of the Sankarani River.
The Kangaba, Koulikoro Region of south-western Mali.
Woulli, Bambouk, in eastern Senegal.
The Ouattara Empire, centered in Northeastern Ivory Coast that also encompassed much of present-day Burkina Faso.The Manden region is considered to be the country of origin of the Manding, in the south of Mali. The Mandinka inhabited this area alongside other ethnic groups who came from the Manding, the Susu who migrated out of Manden Reigon and the Khassonke who are a mix of Mandinka and Fulani.
