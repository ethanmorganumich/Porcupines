Psychoanalysis and music
||||||
Music has the ability to open doors, which allow us to see beyond a typical conversation or thought process. The artistic attributions that are involved in making and listening to music exist as a reliable source for investigating the unconscious mind.  A psychoanalysis of how a person experiences music will show how it is able to help people improve their quality of life.
