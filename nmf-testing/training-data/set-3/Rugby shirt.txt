Rugby shirt
||||||
A rugby shirt, also known as a rugby jersey, is worn by players of rugby union or rugby league. It usually has short sleeves, though long sleeves are common as well.
Traditionally, rugby shirts have had a buttoned opening at the top, in a similar style to polo shirts but with a stiffer collar. However, modern rugby shirts often have a very small collar, or none at all, so as to provide less material for a potential tackler to latch onto (even though such an action is illegal during a game). Due to the nature of the game, the fabric is generally strong, and traditionally rugby shirts have rubber buttons so that they would, if pulled on in a game, come undone rather than pop off. 
A traditional design of rugby shirt consists of five or six horizontal stripes or "hoops" in alternating colours. Rugby league shirts often have a large 'V' around the neck as part of their design. Football shirts, by contrast, traditionally generally have vertical stripes. Rugby shirts, like most sport shirts, will usually have a number on the back, though shirts not meant for competitive play will usually forgo this. Logos and labels of sponsorship are now common, and generally appear on the abdominal area of the shirt.
