During the 17th, 18th, and 19th century, European nations began to consolidate naval routes into South East Asia, whereby India was used as the main trade route for ships to stop and refuel or trade. Over this time, mostly during the 19th century, various Western Colonies began to gain influence various countries and construct colonial architecture in Southeast Asia. This period saw many classical buildings constructed in the neoclassical and French Colonial style of architecture.
