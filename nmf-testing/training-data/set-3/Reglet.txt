Reglet
||||||
A reglet is found on the exterior of a building along a masonry wall, chimney or parapet that meets the roof. It is a groove cut within a mortar joint that receives counter-flashing meant to cover surface flashing used to deflect water infiltration. Reglet can also refer to the counter-flashing itself when it is applied on the surface, known as "face reglet" or "reglet-flashing".
