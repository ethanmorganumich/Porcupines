Swiss Chalet Revival architecture
||||||
Swiss Chalet Revival architecture developed in the United States, emulating original Swiss chalet style of Switzerland. In the U.S., buildings designed in this style might be termed with the word "Revival" or might not be, but none of them are really Swiss, so it is appropriate to term them "Revival".
