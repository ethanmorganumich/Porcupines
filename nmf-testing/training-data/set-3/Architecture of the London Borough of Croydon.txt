Architecture of the London Borough of Croydon
||||||
The London Borough of Croydon has a wide variety of buildings mainly from post-war through to modern. Much of the modern architecture in the borough is centred on the commercial centre of the town, with much of the Victorian designs spread out on both the northern and southern corridors of the borough. Many former warehouses and factories have been converted for other uses changing the external appearance of Croydon erratically.
Croydon also has a number of high rise buildings. Most were built during the sixties and seventies. However, in the last few years there has been a renewed interest in constructing tall buildings in Croydon. Numerous residential and office blocks are being built or have recently been built in the town centre. Saffron Square, a residential building completed in 2016, overtook Altitude 25 as Croydon's tallest tower. A taller building, Croydon Vocational Tower, was scheduled to finish construction in 2010 near East Croydon station. As of August 2015, however, construction had not taken place. As of 2014, there are several upcoming architectural projects in the centre of the borough in the form of the Croydon Gateway scheme and the Cherry Orchard Road Towers.
