Peranakan beaded slippers
||||||
Peranakan beaded slippers, also known as Kasut Manik, literally meaning "beaded shoes", is a type of shoe that dates back to the early twentieth century Malaya. It refers to beaded slippers worn by a nyonya to complete her Sarong Kebaya outfit, together with chained brooches (kerosang) and a silver belt (tali pending). The slippers are made of Peranakan cut beads (Manik Potong), which are treasured as these beads are no longer available. Vintage Kasut Maniks are intricate and finely stitched, a testimony to the fine workmanship of yesteryears. The intricacy and fine workmanship of a pair of the beaded slipper is also a hallmark of highly accomplished Peranakan women, also known as Nyonya, whose skills in embroidery and beadwork are highly valued.
