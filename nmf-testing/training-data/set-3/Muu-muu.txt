Muumuu
||||||
The muumuu  or muʻumuʻu (Hawaiian pronunciation: [ˈmuʔuˈmuʔu]) is a loose dress of Hawaiian origin that hangs from the shoulder and is like a cross between a shirt and a robe.  Like the aloha shirt, muumuu exports are often brilliantly colored with floral patterns of generic Polynesian motifs.  Muumuus for local Hawaiian residents are more subdued in tone.  Muumuus are no longer as widely worn at work as an aloha shirt, but continue to be the preferred formal dress for weddings and festivals such as the Merrie Monarch hula competition.  Muumuus are also popular as maternity wear because they do not restrict the waist.
