Disembowelment
||||||
Disembowelment or evisceration is the removal of some or all of the organs of the gastrointestinal tract (the bowels, or viscera), usually through a horizontal incision made across the abdominal area.  Disembowelment may result from an accident but has also been used as a method of torture and execution.  In such practices, disembowelment may be accompanied by other forms of torture, or the removal of other vital organs.
