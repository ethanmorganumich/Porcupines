||||||
Youth in Cambodia (under age thirty) make up 65.3% of Cambodia's 14,805,000 people.  Twenty-six percent of Cambodians are between the ages of 14 and 30 and another 30% are under 14. All of the youth in the country are second and third generation offspring of survivors of the Khmer Rouge, a genocide that occurred from 1975-1979.  Roughly 20% of the population resides in its cities, mostly in Phnom Penh, the capital.
