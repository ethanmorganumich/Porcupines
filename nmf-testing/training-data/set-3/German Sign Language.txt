German Sign Language or Deutsche Geb√§rdensprache (DGS), is the sign language of the deaf community in Germany, Luxembourg and in the German-speaking community of Belgium. It is unclear how many use German Sign Language as their main language; Gallaudet University estimated 50,000 as of 1986.
The language has evolved through use in deaf communities over hundreds of years.
