Architecture of Kerala
||||||
Kerala architecture is a style of architecture found mostly in the Indian state of Kerala and in parts of Tulu Nadu region of Karnataka. Kerala's style of architecture is a unique Hindu temple architecture that emerged in the southwest part of India, in slight contrast to Dravidian architecture practised in other parts of southern India. The architecture of Kerala has been derived mostly from Indian Vedic architectural tradition and forms a part of the Dravidian architecture, one of the three styles of temples mentioned in the ancient books on Vastu Shastra. The Tantrasamuchaya, Thachu-Shastra, Manushyalaya Chandrika, and Silparatna are architectural treatises which have had an impact on architecture of Kerala . The Manushyalaya-Chandrika, a work devoted to domestic architecture, has its roots in Kerala.
