Nusach (Jewish music)
||||||
In Judaism, musical nusach refers the musical style or tradition of a community, particularly the chant used for recitative prayers such as the Amidah. 
This is distinct from textual nusach, the exact text of the prayer service, which varies somewhat between Jewish communities.
