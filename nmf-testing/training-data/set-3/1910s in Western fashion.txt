1910s in Western fashion
||||||
Fashion from 1910â€“1919 in the Western world was characterized by a rich and exotic opulence in the first half of the decade in contrast with the somber practicality of garments worn during the Great War.  Men's trousers were worn cuffed to ankle-length and creased.  Skirts rose from floor length to well above the ankle, women began to bob their hair, and the stage was set for the radical new fashions associated with the Jazz Age of the 1920s.
