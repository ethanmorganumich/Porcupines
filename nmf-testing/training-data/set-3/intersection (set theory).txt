Intersection (set theory)
||||||
In set theory, the intersection of two sets 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   and 
  
    
      
        B
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle B,}
   denoted by 
  
    
      
        A
        âˆ©
        B
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle A\cap B,}
   is the set containing all elements of 
  
    
      
        A
      
    
    {\displaystyle A}
   that also belong to 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   or equivalently, all elements of 
  
    
      
        B
      
    
    {\displaystyle B}
   that also belong to 
  
    
      
        A
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle A.}
