Phosphorus deficiency
||||||
Phosphorus deficiency is a plant disorder associated with insufficient supply of phosphorus.  Phosphorus refers here to salts of phosphates (PO43−), monohydrogen phosphate (HPO42−), and dihydrogen phosphate (H2PO4−).  These anions readily interconvert, and the predominant species is determined by the pH of the solution or soil.  Phosphates are required for the biosynthesis of genetic material as well as ATP, essential for life.  Phosphorus deficiency can be controlled by applying sources of phosphorus such as bone meal, rock phosphate, manure, and phosphate-fertilizers.
