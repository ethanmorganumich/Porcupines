Sliver building
||||||
A sliver building is a tall slender building constructed on a lot with a narrow frontage, typically 45 feet (14 m) or less. Since the mid-1980s, one of the most remarkable advances in tall building design has been their construction to unprecedented slenderness ratios.The now defunct New York City Board of Estimate banned these type of structures from many residential zoning districts in New York City in 1983, after residents objected to their construction. The resurgence of the real estate market there prior to the economic downturn of 2008 led to a resurgence of these buildings, now constructed in commercial districts.
