Bahag (garment)
||||||
Bahag is a loincloth that was commonly used by men throughout the pre-colonial Philippines. They were either made from barkcloth or from hand-woven textiles. Before the colonial period, bahag were a common garment for commoners and the serf class (the alipin caste). Bahag survives in some indigenous tribes of the Philippines today - most notably the Cordillerans in Northern Luzon.
