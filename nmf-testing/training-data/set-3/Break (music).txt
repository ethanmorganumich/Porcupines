Break (music)
||||||
In popular music, a break is an instrumental or percussion section during a song derived from or related to stop-time â€“ being a "break" from the main parts of the song or piece. A break is usually interpolated between sections of a song, to provide a sense of anticipation, signal the start of a new section, or create variety in the arrangement.
