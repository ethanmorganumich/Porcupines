English bagpipes
||||||
When bagpipes arrived in England is unknown, there is some evidence to suggest Anglo-Saxon times, however the oldest confirmed proof of the existence of bagpipes anywhere in the world comes from three separate sources in the 13th century. Two of them English; the Tenison Marginalie Psalter from Westminster and an entry into the accounts books of Edward the I of England recording the purchase of a set of bagpipes. The third from the Cantigas Del Santa Maria published in Spain. From the 14th century onwards, bagpipes start to appear in the historical records of European countries, however half the mentions come from England suggesting Bagpipes were more common in England.
Bagpipes are mentioned in English literature as early as The Canterbury Tales by Geoffrey Chaucer, written between the 1380s and 1390s. Writing in the Prologue about the Miller, the lines read:

A baggepype wel coude he blowe and sowne,
And ther-with-al he broghte us out of towne.
Stone and wood carvings of bagpipes of many different types began to appear in English cathedrals and churches beginning in the 14th century; examples of such carvings may be found in Cornwall, Dorset, Devon, Herefordshire, Yorkshire, Cambridgeshire, Manchester, Norfolk, and Shropshire.Bagpipes increased in popularity across England and Europe throughout the 15th to 17th centuries. During the Baroque era the same technological increase that allowed the development of Baroque instruments was applied to the bagpipes and they became more sophisticated too, which along with a decrease in size and volume of pipes, small parlour pipes becoming preferred, the crude great pipes of medieval times died out. By the 17th century the Pastoral pipes had become the most popular pipes in England and were exported to Ireland by Protestant settlers. During the 19th century Europe (except Scotland) experienced a massive loss of popularity in the piping and their piping traditions died out, only to be reborn again in the 20th century.
The only surviving unbroken English piping tradition is that of the Northumbrian smallpipes, which are used in Northumberland and Durham. In addition, the related Border pipe traditional of Northern England and Lowland Scotland has undergone a revival.
