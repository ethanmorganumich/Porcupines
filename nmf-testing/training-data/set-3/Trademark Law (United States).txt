United States trademark law
||||||
A trademark is a word, phrase, or logo that identifies the source of goods or services. Trademark law protects a business' commercial identity or brand by discouraging other businesses from adopting a name or logo that is "confusingly similar" to an existing trademark. The goal is to allow consumers to easily identify the producers of goods and services and avoid confusion.United States trademark law is mainly governed by the Lanham Act. Common law trademark rights are acquired automatically when a business uses a name or logo in commerce, and are enforceable in state courts. Marks registered with the   U.S. Patent and Trademark Office are given a higher degree of protection in federal courts than unregistered marksâ€”both registered and unregistered trademarks are granted some degree of federal protection under the Lanham Act 43(a).
