Copyist
||||||
A copyist is a person that makes duplications of the same thing. The term is sometimes used for artists who make copies of other artists' paintings.  However, the modern use of the term is almost entirely confined to music copyists, who are employed by the music industry to produce neat copies from a composer or arranger's manuscript.
