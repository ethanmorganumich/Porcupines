Vastese (Vastese: Lu Uâʃtaréule or Lu indialett di lu Uašt, meaning "the dialect of Vasto") is a Romance language spoken in the town of Vasto. It is considered its own language based upon the mutual unintelligibility of it and Italian. It is not spoken by any other town, even the nearby town of Cupello, which is only 9 kilometres (5.6 mi) away.
