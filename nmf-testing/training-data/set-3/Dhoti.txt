Dhoti
||||||
The dhoti, also known as veshti, vetti, dhuti, mardani, chaadra, dhotar, jai√±boh, panchey, is a type of sarong, tied in a manner that outwardly resembles "loose trousers". It is a lower garment forming part of the ethnic costume for men in the Indian subcontinent. The dhoti is fashioned out of a rectangular piece of unstitched cloth, usually around 4.5 metres (15 ft) long, wrapped around the waist and the legs and knotted, either in the front or the back. The dhoti is touted as the male counterpart of the sari worn by females to religious and secular ceremonies (functions). Pitambar is a yellow silk dhoti, worn on auspicious occasions. The dhoti which is worn around the lower waist and drawn up in between the legs, is a 5-yard-long piece of woven fabric; it must not be confused with pre-stitched "dhoti pants", which are a new ready to wear trend these days, popular among women and typical of children.
