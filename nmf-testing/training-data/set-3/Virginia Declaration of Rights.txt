Virginia Declaration of Rights
||||||
The Virginia Declaration of Rights was drafted in 1776 to proclaim the inherent rights of men, including the right to reform or abolish "inadequate" government.  It influenced a number of later documents, including the United States Declaration of Independence (1776) and the United States Bill of Rights (1789).
