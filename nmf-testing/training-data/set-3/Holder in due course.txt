Holder in due course
||||||
The holder in due course (HDC) theory is a rule in commercial law that protects a purchaser of debt, where the purchaser is assigned the right to receive the debt payments. The theory insulates the purchaser of debt, or other obligation to pay, against charges that either party to the original transaction might have had against the other.
