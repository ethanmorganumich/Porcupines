Bit-count integrity
||||||
In telecommunication, the term bit-count integrity (BCI) has the following meanings: 

In message communications, the preservation of the exact number of bits that are in the original message.
In connection-oriented services, preservation of the number of bits per unit time.Note:  Bit-count integrity is not the same as bit integrity, which requires that the delivered bits correspond exactly with the original bits.
