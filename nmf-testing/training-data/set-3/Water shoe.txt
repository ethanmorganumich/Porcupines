Water shoe
||||||
A water shoe is a type of footwear that is typically used for activities where the feet are likely to become wet, such as kayaking. Water shoes are usually made of mesh and have a hard sole used to prevent cuts and abrasions when walking in wet, rocky environments. They may often have tiny holes on the bottom or sides of the sole to allow for quick water drainage, which keeps helps the wearer's feet dry faster, keeps the shoe light, and prolongs the lifespan of the material. Additionally, most people do not wear socks with water shoes.
