Comtois steeple
||||||
The Comtois steeple is a typical bell tower on Christian churches with an imperial dome in Franche-Comté, France. Nearly 700 Comtois steeples remain in this eastern traditional province.
This kind of steeple is incorporated into the entrance of the churches restored mainly during the eighteenth century after destructions in the Thirty Years' War in that country and French conquest in 1678. The cloister vault with raised sides ("dôme à pans relevés") and the polychrome glazed tiles on the roofs are typical characteristics of this regional church architecture.
