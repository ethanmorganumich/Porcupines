Dolman
||||||
The somewhat vaguely defined term dolman (from Turkish dolaman "robe" ) can refer to various types of clothing, all of which have sleeves and cover the top part of the body, and sometimes more.  Originally, the term dolaman referred to a long and loose garment with narrow sleeves and an opening in the front. Generally worn by Turks, it resembled a cassock in shape.
