Cagoule
||||||
A cagoule (French: [ka…°ul]), also spelled cagoul, kagoule or kagool, is the British English term for a lightweight weatherproof raincoat or anorak with a hood (usually without lining), which often comes in knee-length form. The Canadian English equivalent is windbreaker. The word cagoule is borrowed from the French for balaclava or hood.
In some versions, when rolled up, the hood or cross-chest front pocket doubles as a bag into which the shell can be packed.
