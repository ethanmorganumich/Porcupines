Collective landscape
||||||
The term collective landscape was introduced to landscape design and landscape planning by Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe. He wrote, on the dust jacket of his book:

The landscape of man, that  "The world is moving into a phase when landscape design may well be recognized as the most comprehensive of the arts. Man creates around him an environment that is a projection into nature of his abstract ideas. It is only in the present century that the collective landscape has emerged as a social necessity. We are promoting a landscape art on a scale never conceived of in history."
