Codpiece
||||||
A codpiece (from Middle English: cod, meaning "scrotum") is a triangular piece that attached to the front of men's hose, covering the fly. It may be held in place by ties or buttons. It was an important fashion item of European clothing during the 15thâ€“16th centuries. In the modern era, similar clothing pieces are worn in the leather subculture, and in performance costumes, such as for rock music and metal musicians. A similar device with rigid construction, an athletic cup, is used as protective gear for male athletes.
