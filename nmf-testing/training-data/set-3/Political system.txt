Political system
||||||
In political science, a political system means the type of political organization that can be recognized, observed or otherwise declared by a state.It defines the process for making official government decisions. It usually comprizes the governmental  legal and economic system, social and cultural system, and other state and government specific systems. However, this is a very simplified view of a much more complex system of categories involving the questions of who should have authority and what the government influence on its people and economy should be.
The major types of political systems are democracies, monarchies, and authoritarian and totalitarian regimes with varying hybrid systems.
