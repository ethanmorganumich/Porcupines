Polka dot is a pattern consisting of an array of large filled circles of the same size.Polka dots are commonly seen on children's clothing, toys, furniture, ceramics, and Central European folk art but they appear in a wide array of contexts. The pattern rarely appears in formal contexts, and is generally confined to more playful attire such as bathing suits and lingerie. Occasionally, white-on-black small dots appear on more formal clothing.
