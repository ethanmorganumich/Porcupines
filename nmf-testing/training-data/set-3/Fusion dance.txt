Fusion dance
||||||
Fusion dance is done within a community of social dancers that have a variety of views on what it means to Fusion dance. 
Some will say it is a dance form of its own while others will say that it is not a dance form but a way of dancing and thinking about dance (and teaching/organising dance). 
Some might say it is a type of contemporary social improvised partner dance that combines different dance styles to create a new aesthetic, while others believe it doesn't need to be contemporary, and it doesn't need to combine different dance styles, and doesn't need to create a new aesthetic (but often does have elements of each of these). 
Most agree it does not require conforming to any particular defined dance styles, but typically uses a lead-follow approach that emphasises musicality.Fusion dancing may involve creating a new dance style, recreating an already established dance style, combining existing styles of movement, or any combination of the above (as well as many other possibilities we probably haven't thought of yet).
