Theories of victimology
||||||
Victimology is the study of crime victims and their circumstances, including the factors contributing to (and after-effects of) their victimization.
To do this, one would also have to study how the criminals grew interests in their victims and their relationships with them. And they also look into the norms of the society in which the criminal lives in and how a victim might fit a specific pattern. Victimology has a broad range of different theories; the most prevalent one is abuse.
Various theories of victimology exist, each with the aim of explaining why certain people become victims of crimes, and why others do not. Some people view some theories in a negative light, believing that to conjecture as to the causes of victimization is tantamount to blaming the victim for crime, at least partly.
