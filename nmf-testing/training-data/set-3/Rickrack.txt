Rickrack
||||||
Rickrack is a flat piece of braided trim, shaped like a zigzag. It is used as a decorative element in clothes or curtains.  Before the prevalence of sewing machines and overlockers, rickrack was used to provide a finished edge to fabric, and its popularity was in part due to its sturdiness and ability to stand up to harsh washing conditions. Rickrack is produced using a variety of fibers, including cotton, polyester, wool, and metallic fibers, and is sold in a variety of sizes and colors.Invented in the mid-19th century, it took its modern form and current name around 1880.  Rickrack's popularity peaked in the 1970s and is associated with the Little House on the Prairie. Several designs of formal and up-market girls' dresses with it on as a decoration became popular in the 1950s and 1960s.
