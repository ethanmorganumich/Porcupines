California Virtual Academies
||||||
California Virtual Academies (CAVA) are nine virtual charter schools with business agreements with the curriculum-provider K12 Inc. The nine virtual charter schools are CAVA@Fresno, CAVA@Kings, CAVA@Los Angeles, CAVA@Maricopa, CAVA@San Diego, CAVA@San Joaquin, CAVA@San Mateo, CAVA@Sonoma, and CAVA@Sutter.
Although all public charter schools are nonprofit organizations, they are affiliated with a for-profit company, K12 Inc. Each of the nine academies has its own independent board of directors. Each of the California Virtual Academies follow the educational principles of E.D. Hirsch Jr.
Each student of the California Virtual Academies is assigned to a California-credentialed homeroom teacher with 30â€“35 students each. The academies, like most K12 Inc.-supplied schools, loan the student textbooks, materials, and a computer so the student can access online lessons.
