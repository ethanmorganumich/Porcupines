Independent Australian Jewish Voices (IAJV) is an Australian Jewish advocacy organisation. IAJV was launched on March 5, 2007 following the emergence of similar groups overseas in Britain (Independent Jewish Voices) and Germany (Schalom 5767), and earlier in the US (Jewish Voice for Peace), and Netherlands (Een Ander Joods Geluid).
