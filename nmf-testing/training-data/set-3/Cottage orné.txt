Cottage orné (French for 'decorated cottage') dates back to a movement of "rustic" stylised cottages of the late 18th and early 19th centuries during the Romantic movement, when some sought to discover a more natural way of living as opposed to the formality of the preceding Baroque and Neoclassical architectural styles. English Heritage define the term as "A rustic building of picturesque design." They often feature well-shaped thatch roofs with ornate timberwork.
