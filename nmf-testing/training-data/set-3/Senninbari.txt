Senninbari
||||||
A senninbari (千人針, "thousand person stitches) or one thousand stitch is a belt or strip of cloth stitched 1000 times and given as a Shinto amulet by Japanese women and imperial subjects to soldiers going away to war.
Senninbari were decorated with 1000 knots or stitches, and each stitch was normally made by a different woman. Senninbari were typically 15 centimetres (5.9 in) wide and ranged from 90 centimetres (3.0 ft) to 120 centimetres (3.9 ft) or more in length. Each end of the belt could feature strings, snaps or buttons that allowed it to be fastened around the waist; examples lacking these were often tucked into the waist. Other variations were never worn, but may have been folded and placed inside helmet liners, pockets or packs.
