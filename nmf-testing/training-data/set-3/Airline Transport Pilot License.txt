The airline transport pilot license (ATPL), or in the United States of America, an airline transport pilot (ATP) certificate  is the highest level of aircraft pilot certificate. In the United States, those certified as airline transport pilots (unconditional) are authorized to act as pilot in command on scheduled air carriers' aircraft under CFR 14 Part 121. In the UK, pilots must hold an ATPL before they can be pilot in command on an aircraft with 9 or more passenger seats.
