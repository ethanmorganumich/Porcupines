Synchronization

Synchronization is the coordination of events to operate a system in unison. For example, the conductor of an orchestra keeps the orchestra synchronized or in time. Systems that operate with all parts in synchrony are said to be synchronous or in syncâ€”and those that are not are asynchronous.
Today, time synchronization can occur between systems around the world through satellite navigation signals and other time and frequency transfer techniques.
