Costumed performer
||||||
A costumed performer or suit performer wears a costume that usually, (but not always) covers the performer's face, typically to represent a non-human character such as a mascot or cartoon character. These range from theme park "walk-around" or "meetable" characters, the mascots of corporations, schools, or sports teams to novelty act performers. Some costumes cover the performer's face especially those in theme parks.
Examples include sports mascots and performances as fantasy characters on children's television and in theme parks. Problems in suit performance include intense physical exertion, claustrophobia and hyperthermia.
