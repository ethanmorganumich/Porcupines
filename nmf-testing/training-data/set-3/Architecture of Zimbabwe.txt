Architecture of Zimbabwe

The architecture of Zimbabwe is composed of three architectural types: the Hill Complex, the Valley Complex, and the Great Enclosure. Both traditional and colonial architectures have influenced the history and culture of the country. However, post-1954 buildings are mainly inspired by pre-colonial, traditional architecture, especially Great Zimbabweâ€“inspired structures such as the Kingdom Hotel, Harare international airport, and the National Heroes' Acre.
