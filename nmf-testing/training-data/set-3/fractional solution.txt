Linear programming relaxation

In mathematics, the relaxation of a (mixed) integer linear program is the problem that arises by removing the integrality constraint of each variable.
For example, in a 0–1 integer program, all constraints are of the form

  
    
      
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        ∈
        {
        0
        ,
        1
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}\in \{0,1\}}
  .The relaxation of the original integer program instead uses a collection of linear constraints

  
    
      
        0
        ≤
        
          x
          
            i
          
        
        ≤
        1.
      
    
    {\displaystyle 0\leq x_{i}\leq 1.}
  The resulting relaxation is a linear program, hence the name. This relaxation technique transforms an NP-hard optimization problem (integer programming) into a related problem that is solvable in polynomial time (linear programming); the solution to the relaxed linear program can be used to gain information about the solution to the original integer program.
