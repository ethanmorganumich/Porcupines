Niche real estate

Niche real estate refers to specialized sectors of the property market. Examples include income property, garden real estate, condos, equestrian property, vacation property, farm property, golf property, golf course redevelopment, waterfront homes, beach houses and luxury homes. These are categories in which potential buyers think about the property they seek. They are also used by real estate marketing companies to reach these types of buyers. In this context a niche describes a specific segment of home buyers and sellers, classified by ethnicity, nationality or socio-economic group (e.g., social housing or luxury real estate).
