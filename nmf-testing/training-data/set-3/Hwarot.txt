Hwarot
||||||
Hwarot is a type of traditional Korean clothing worn during the Goryeo and Joseon Dynasty by only royal women for ceremonial occasions and later by commoners for weddings. It is still worn during the p'yebaek phase of modern weddings. Before commoners wore hwarots, they wore wonsam due to the steep cost of a hwarot. The gown is typically worn with a jokduri or hwagwan, binyeo or daenggi, and yeongigonji, which is red and black makeup spots on the cheek and brow.
