Zukra
||||||
The zukra (zokra, zoughara, Arabic: زكرة) is a Libyan bagpipe with a double-chanter terminating in two cow horns; it is similar in construction to the Tunisian mizwad.
The instrument is played as a bagpipe in the south and west of Libya, but played by mouth without a bag in the east.  The instrument is played at feasts, weddings, and funerals.
