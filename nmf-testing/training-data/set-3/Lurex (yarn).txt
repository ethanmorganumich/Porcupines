Lurex
||||||
Lurex is the registered brand name of the Lurex Company, Ltd. for a type of yarn with a metallic appearance. The yarn is made from synthetic film, onto which a metallic aluminium, silver, or gold layer has been vaporized. "Lurex" may also refer to cloth created with the yarn. The word “lurex” is absent in the English language as a common noun: this is the name of the trademark and the company Lurex Company Limited, which launched the production of such yarn based on nylon and polyester — Lurex in the 1970s. The name was based on the English lure — “temptation; attractiveness”.
