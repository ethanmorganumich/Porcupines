Transition metal

In chemistry, a transition metal (or transition element) is a chemical element that has a partly filled d subshell in elemental form or as an ion in compounds, which allows the d orbitals to participate in chemical bonding. The transition metals are approximately those elements in the d-block of the periodic table, a criterion that is sometimes used to define them. Definitions of the term transition metal vary, but usually include all the elements of groups 4 through 11, and the group 3 elements scandium and yttrium. They often also include lanthanum and actinium, or lutetium and lawrencium. The f-block lanthanide and actinide series are called inner transition metals and are sometimes considered to be transition metals. 
Since they are metals, they are lustrous and have good electrical and thermal conductivity. Most (with the exception of group 11 and group 12) are hard and strong, and have high melting and boiling temperatures. They form compounds in any of two or more different oxidation states and bind to a variety of ligands to form coordination complexes that are often coloured. They form many useful alloys and are often employed as catalysts in elemental form or in compounds such as coordination complexes and oxides. Most are strongly paramagnetic because of their unpaired d electrons, as are many of their compounds. All of the elements that are ferromagnetic near room temperature are transition metals (iron, cobalt and nickel) or inner transition metals (gadolinium). 
English chemist Charles Rugeley Bury (1890â€“1968) first used the word transition in this context in 1921, when he referred to a transition series of elements during the change of an inner layer of electrons (for example n = 3 in the 4th row of the periodic table) from a stable group of 8 to one of 18, or from 18 to 32. These elements are now known as the d-block.
