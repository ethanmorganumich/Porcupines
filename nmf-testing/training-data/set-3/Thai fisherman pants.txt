Thai fisherman pants (Thai: กางเกงเล, RTGS: kangkeng le, pronounced [kāːŋ.kēːŋ lēː]; Northern Thai: กางเกงสะดอ, RTGS: kangkeng sa do, pronounced [sa.dɔɔ]) are lightweight unisex trousers that are made wide in the waist so that one size fits all. The pants are wrapped around the waist and ribbons are tied to form a belt. Excess material is then folded over the knot.Thai fisherman pants are very similar to the traditional attire of Intha and Shan males, the former of whom live on Inle Lake of Myanmar. They are known in Burmese as shan baung-mi (ရှမ်းဘောင်းဘီ).
