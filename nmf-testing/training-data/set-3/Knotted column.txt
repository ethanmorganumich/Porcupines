Knotted column
||||||
Knotted column (also serpent column) is an architectural element, consisting of a pair of columns joined together by a "flat knot". The column was particularly used during the Romanesque period when it spread in a wide geographical area between Northern Italy, Bavaria, and Burgundy, and was particularly associated with the work of the Comacine masters and the Cistercian order.
