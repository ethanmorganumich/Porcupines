The Kikuyu (also Agĩkũyũ/Gĩkũyũ) are a Bantu ethnic group native to Central Kenya.  At a population of 8,148,668 as of 2019, they account for 17.13% of the total population of Kenya, making them the largest ethnic group in Kenya.
The term Kikuyu is derived from the Swahili form of the word Gĩkũyũ. Gĩkũyũ is derived from the word mũkũyũ which means sycamore fig (mũkũyũ) tree". Hence Agĩkũyũ in the Kikuyu language translates to "Children Of The Big Sycamore". The alternative name Nyũmba ya Mũmbi, which encompasses Embu, Gikuyu, and Meru, translates to "House of the Potter" (or "Creator").
