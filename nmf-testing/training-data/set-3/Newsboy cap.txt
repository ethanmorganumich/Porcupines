Newsboy cap
||||||
The newsboy cap, newsie cap, or baker boy hat (British) is a casual-wear cap similar in style to the flat cap. 
It has a similar overall shape and stiff peak (visor) in front as a flat cap, but the body of the cap is rounder, made of eight pieces, fuller, and paneled with a button on top, and often with a button attaching the front to the brim (as the flat cap sometimes has).
