An architectural educator is a person who trains prospective professional architects and architectural technicians. This involves training in the discipline of architectural design or more specifically, the design of constructed environments.  
Architectural Education has both public architectural education and professional architectural education stakeholder groups.Architectural educators may work in the service of the architectural profession or in the wider community. Architectural education in many countries is regulated by validation or accreditation. In the wider community, architectural educators may use their knowledge to raise citizens or members of a community's awareness of their respective environment, and their role in its ownership and custodianship.
Architectural Educators are represented by national and regional associations such as ACSA in the US, the ACA in Australia and New Zealand, and the EAAE in Europe.
