The Royal Air Force uniform is the standardised military dress worn by members of the Royal Air Force.  The predominant colours of Royal Air Force uniforms are blue-grey and Wedgwood blue.  Many Commonwealth air forces' uniforms are also based on the RAF pattern, but with nationality shoulder flashes. The Royal Air Force Air Cadets wear similar uniforms.
