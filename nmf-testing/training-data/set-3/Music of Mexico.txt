The music of Mexico is very diverse and features a wide range of musical genres and performance styles. It has been influenced by a variety of cultures, most notably deriving from the culture of the Europeans, Indigenous, and Africans. It also sometimes rarely contains influences from Asians and Arabs, as well as from other Hispanic and Latino cultures. Music was an expression of Mexican nationalism, beginning in the nineteenth century.
