Mandapa
||||||
A mandapa or mantapa (Sanskrit: मण्डप, romanized: Maṇḍapa) is a pillared hall or pavilion for public rituals in Indian architecture, especially featured in Hindu temple architecture.Mandapas are described as "open" or "closed" depending on whether they have walls. In temples, one or more mandapas very often lie between the sanctuary and the temple entrance, on the same axis. In a large temple other mandapas may be placed to the sides, or detached within the temple compound.
