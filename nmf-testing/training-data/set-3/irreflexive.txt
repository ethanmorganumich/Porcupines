Reflexive relation
||||||
In mathematics, a binary relation R on a set X is reflexive if it relates every element of X to itself.An example of a reflexive relation is the relation "is equal to" on the set of real numbers, since every real number is equal to itself.  A reflexive relation is said to have the reflexive property or is said to possess reflexivity.  Along with symmetry and transitivity, reflexivity is one of three properties defining equivalence relations.
