Smoking jacket
||||||
A smoking jacket is an informal men's style of lounge jacket originally intended for tobacco smoking, designed in the 1850s. A classic-styled smoking jacket comes in a shawl collar, turn-up cuffs, toggle or button fastenings, or simply be closed with a tie belt. It is usually made from velvet, silk, or both.
Originating in the 1850s, The Gentleman's Magazine of London, England, defined the smoking jacket as a "kind of short robe de chambre [i.e. a banyan], of velvet, cashmere, plush, merino or printed flannel, lined with bright colours, ornamented with brandebourgs [i.e. frogs], olives or large buttons."The smoking jacket evolved out of the dinner jacket, essentially as a dress coat without tails, following an example set by the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) in 1865. It has existed in this form ever since and is most commonly worn when smoking pipes and cigars.
