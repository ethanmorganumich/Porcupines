Airports Commission
||||||
The Airports Commission was an independent commission established in September 2012 by the Government of the United Kingdom to consider how the UK can "maintain its status as an international hub for aviation and immediate actions to improve the use of existing runway capacity in the next 5 years". Alongside the proposal to build HS2, the question of how to make best use of and expand airport capacity has become the UK's most significant infrastructure issue over the last few years.
The five person commission, which was chaired by the economist Sir Howard Davies and reported to the Department for Transport (DfT), produced an Interim Report in December 2013 and delivered a Final Report in July 2015.
In 2009, Sir Howard Davies had been appointed as advisor to the Investment Strategy Committee of GIC Private Limited, formerly known as Government Investment Corporation of Singapore, and in 2011 he had joined its International Advisory Board. Davies resigned from both positions in September 2012, on his appointment to chair the Airports Commission (as GIC Private Limited was, at the time, as it still is, one of Heathrow's principal owners and cheerleaders for Heathrow's expansion). Davies recorded neither of these remunerated interests, when invited to complete the Airports Commission's Register of Interests.
