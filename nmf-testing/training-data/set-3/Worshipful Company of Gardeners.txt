Worshipful Company of Gardeners
||||||
The Worshipful Company of Gardeners is one of the livery companies of the City of London. An organisation of Gardeners existed in the middle of the fourteenth century; it received a royal charter in 1605. The company no longer exists as a regulatory authority for the sale of produce in London; instead serving as a charitable institution. The company also performs a ceremonial role; it formally presents bouquets to the queen and to princesses upon their wedding, anniversary, or other similar occasion.
The Gardeners' Company ranks sixty-sixth in the order of precedence for livery companies. Its motto is In The Sweat Of Thy Brows Shalt Thow Eate Thy Bread.
The livery is led by a master, assisted by the upper warden and the renter warden. Other officers of the livery include the clerk and the spadebearer.
