Leaf blower
||||||
A leaf blower, commonly known as a blower, is a gardening tool that propels air out of a nozzle to move debris such as leaves and grass cuttings.  Leaf blowers are powered by electric or gasoline motors. Gasoline models have traditionally been two-stroke engines, but four-stroke engines were recently introduced to partially address air pollution concerns. Leaf blowers are typically self-contained handheld units, or backpack mounted units with a handheld wand. The latter is more ergonomic for prolonged use. Larger units may rest on wheels and even use a motor for propulsion. These are sometimes called "walk-behind leaf blowers" because they must be pushed by hand to be operated. Some units called blower vacs, can also suck in leaves and small twigs via a vacuum, and shred them into a bag.

Leaf blowers are a source of controversy due to their adverse impacts such as operator injury including hearing loss, particulates air pollution, noise pollution, and ecological habitat destruction. Over 200 localities have restricted the use of leaf blowers and many major cities including Washington DC are implementing total bans due to the negative effects to operator health, ecological destruction, pollution, and nuisances including noise. October 9, 2021, California passed an air pollution control law AB1346 phasing out small off-road engines, like those found in leaf blowers, set to take effect January 1, 2024.
