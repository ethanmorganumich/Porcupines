Celtic chant
||||||
Celtic chant is the liturgical plainchant repertory of the Celtic rite of the Catholic Church performed in Britain, Ireland and Brittany. It is related to, but distinct from the Gregorian chant of the Sarum use of the Roman rite which officially supplanted it by the 12th century.  Although no  Celtic chant was notated, some traces of its musical style are believed to remain.
