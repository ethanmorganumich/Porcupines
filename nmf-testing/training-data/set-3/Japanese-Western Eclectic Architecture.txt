Japanese-Western Eclectic Architecture

Japanese-Western Eclectic Architecture (Japanese: 和洋折衷建築, Hepburn: Wayō Se'chū Kenchiku) is an architectural style that emerged from the Eclecticism in architecture movement of the late 19th and early 20th century, which intentionally incorporated Japanese architectural and Western architectural components into one building design. The style is both a precursor to and a style of Modern Japanese Architecture (近代和風建築, Kindai Wafū Kenchiku).
The style emerged in Yokohama in the 1853–1867 Bakumatsu period, and spread throughout Japan after the 1868 Meiji Restoration, and then to Asian and Western countries during the expansion of the Empire of Japan.This architectural style is characterised by both components of enlightenment Western-style architecture and components of historically emblematic traditional Japanese architecture.Buildings that are early exemplary representations of this style are: The First National Bank of Japan (第一国立銀行, Daiichi Kokuritsu Ginkō) built by Mistui Group (三井組, Mistui Gumi) in 1872, the Kaichi School Museum building built in 1876, and Seika Restaurant (清華亭, Seika Tei) built in 1881.
