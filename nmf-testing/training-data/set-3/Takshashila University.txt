University of ancient Taxila

The University of ancient Takshashila was an ancient Brahmanical university located in the city of Takṣaśilā (Sanskrit: तक्षशिला) (Taxila in modern-day Pakistan) near the bank of the Indus River. According to the Ramayana, the city was founded by Bharata, the son of Kaikeyi, and younger stepbrother of Rama. Along with Nalanda, Taxila was one of the leading seats of higher learning in ancient India. It became the capital of the Achaemenid territories in northwestern Indian subcontinent following the Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley around 540 BCE. Taxila was at the crossroad of the main trade roads of Asia, and was probably populated by Persians, Greeks, Scythians and many ethnicities coming from the various parts of the Achaemenid Empire.
