Autoplastic adaptation
||||||
Autoplastic adaptation (from the Greek word auto) is a form of adaptation where the subject attempts to change itself when faced with a difficult situation.
The concept of autoplastic adaptation was developed by Sigmund Freud, SÃ¡ndor Ferenczi, and Franz Alexander. They proposed that when an individual was presented with a stressful situation, he could react in one of two ways: 

Autoplastic adaptation: The subject tries to change himself, i.e. the internal environment.
Alloplastic adaptation: The subject tries to change the situation, i.e. the external environment.
