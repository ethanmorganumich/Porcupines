Plagiarism
||||||
Plagiarism is the fraudulent representation of another person's language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions as one's own original work. While precise definitions vary, depending on the institution, such representations are generally considered to violate academic integrity and journalistic ethics as well as social norms of learning, teaching, research, fairness, respect and responsibility in many cultures. It is subject to sanctions such as penalties, suspension, expulsion from school or work, substantial fines and even imprisonment.Generally, plagiarism is not in itself a crime, but like counterfeiting, fraud can be punished in a court for prejudices caused by copyright infringement, violation of moral rights, or torts. In academia and industry, it is a serious ethical offense. Plagiarism and copyright infringement overlap to a considerable extent, but they are not equivalent concepts, and many types of plagiarism do not constitute copyright infringement, which is defined by copyright law and may be adjudicated by courts.
Not all countries hold the same beliefs about personal ownership of language or ideas.  While some, such as India and Poland, consider plagiarism to be a crime liable for imprisonment, in other countries the reiteration of another professional's work can be a sign of respect or flattery. Students who move to the United States and other Western countries from countries where plagiarism is not frowned upon may find the transition difficult.
