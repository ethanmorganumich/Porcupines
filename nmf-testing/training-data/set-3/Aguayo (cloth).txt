The aguayo (possibly from awayu, Aymara for diaper and for a woven blanket to carry things on the back or to cover the back), or also quepina (possibly from Quechua q'ipi bundle) is a rectangular carrying cloth used in traditional communities in the Andes region of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru. Aymara and Quechua people use it to carry small children or various other items in it on their backs. It is similar to a lliklla and sometimes regarded as a synonym.
