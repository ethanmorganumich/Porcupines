Jharokha
||||||
The Jharokha is a stone window projecting from the wall face of a building, in an upper story, overlooking a street, market, court or any other open space. A common feature in classical Indian architecture, most prominent in Rajasthan. It is supported on two or more brackets or corbelling, has two pillars or pilasters, balustrade and a cupola or pyramidal roof; technically closed by jali but generally partly open for the inmates to peep out to see passing processions. The jharokha is more formal and ornamental than English or French oriel window, and is one of the most distinctive characteristics of the fa√ßade in medieval Indian architecture until the 19th century.
