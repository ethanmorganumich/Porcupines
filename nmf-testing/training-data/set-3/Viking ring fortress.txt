Viking ring fortress
||||||
A Viking ring fortress, or Trelleborg-type fortress, is a type of circular fort of a special design, built in Scandinavia during the Viking Age. Collectively, they may also be known as trelleborgs. These fortresses have a strictly circular shape, with roads and gates pointing in the four cardinal directions. They are sometimes partially encircled by advanced ramparts, though not always circular.
There are a total of seven known Viking ring fortresses at present, located in Denmark and Scania, Sweden. Many of them have been dated to the reign of Harold Bluetooth of Denmark, c. 980. Their exact purpose is subject to debate.
