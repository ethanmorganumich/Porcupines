The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), founded in 1904, is the oldest non-partisan professional organization of public officials in the United States, composed of the secretaries of state of U.S. states and territories. Currently, all secretaries of state, including Washington D.C., Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam) are members of NASS.
NASS maintains its office in Washington, D.C., and promotes positions on issues of interest to secretaries of state: voter turnout, voting procedures, business services, electronic government, securities, and government archives.
Pennsylvania secretary of the commonwealth Pedro A. Cort√©s became the first Puerto Rican president of the organization, and the last one to hold the position for a full one-year term, followed by Maine secretary of state Matthew Dunlap, whose term was cut short by his electoral defeat in the 2010 midterm elections. Minnesota secretary of state Mark Ritchie filled the remainder of Dunlap's term. During the organization's annual summer meeting in San Juan in July 2012, Alabama secretary of state Beth Chapman turned over the presidency to Nevada secretary of state Ross Miller.
