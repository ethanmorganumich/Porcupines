Closed position
||||||
In partner dancing, closed position is a category of positions in which partners hold each other while facing at least approximately toward each other. 
Closed positions employ either body contact or body support, that is, holding each other is not limited to handhold. If the partners are comfortable with each other and the dance style allows it, body contact increases the connection between the partners. Some dances, such as Balboa and Collegiate Shag are only done in body contact.
