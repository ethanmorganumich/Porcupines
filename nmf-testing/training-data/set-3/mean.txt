There are several kinds of mean in mathematics, especially in statistics. Each mean serves to summarize a given group of data, often to better understand the overall value (magnitude and sign) of a given data set. 
For a data set, the arithmetic mean, also known as "arithmetic average", is a measure of central tendency of a finite set of numbers: specifically, the sum of the values divided by the number of values. The arithmetic mean of a set of numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is typically denoted using an overhead bar, 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}
  . If the data set were based on a series of observations obtained by sampling from a statistical population, the arithmetic mean is the sample mean (
  
    
      
        
          
            
              x
              ¯
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\bar {x}}}
  ) to distinguish it from the mean, or expected value, of the underlying distribution, the population mean (denoted 
  
    
      
        μ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu }
   or 
  
    
      
        
          μ
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mu _{x}}
  ).Outside probability and statistics, a wide range of other notions of mean are often used in geometry and mathematical analysis; examples are given below.
