Voluntary euthanasia
||||||
Voluntary euthanasia (VE) is the ending of a person's life at their request in order to relieve them of suffering. Voluntary euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide (PAS) have been the focus of intense debate in recent years.
Some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in certain Australian states, Belgium, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and some provinces in Canada.
