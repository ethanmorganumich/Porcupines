Strapwork

In the history of art and design, strapwork is the use of stylised representations in ornament of ribbon-like forms.  These may loosely imitate leather straps, parchment or metal cut into elaborate shapes, with piercings, and often interwoven in a geometric pattern.  In early examples there may or may not be three-dimensionality, either actual in curling relief ends of the elements, or just represented in two dimensions.  As the style continued, these curling elements became more prominent, often turning into scrollwork, where the ends curl into spirals or scrolls.  By the Baroque scrollwork was a common element in ornament, often partly submerged by other rich ornament.
European strapwork is a frequent background and framework for grotesque ornament – arabesque or candelabra figures filled with fantastical creatures, garlands and other elements – which were a frequent decorative motif in 16th-century Northern Mannerism, and revived in the 19th century and which may appear on walls – painted, in frescos, carved in wood, or moulded in plaster or stucco – or in graphic work.  The Europeanized arabesque patterns called moresque are also very often combined with strapwork, especially in tooled and gilded bookbindings.
Scrollwork is a variant that tended to replace strapwork almost completely by the Baroque.  It is less geometric and more organic, more three dimensional, and with emphasis on the curling ends of the "straps".  The Italian artists at the Palace of Fontainebleau had already moved onto this by the 1530s, but in provincial work in northern Europe flat strapwork panels continued for another century or more.
Where there is no suggestion of three dimensions – curling ends and the like – the decoration may also be called bandwork or "interlaced bands", the more technically correct term.  Peter Fuhring derives this style from Islamic ornament.
