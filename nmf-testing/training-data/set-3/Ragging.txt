Ragging
||||||
Ragging is the term used for the so-called "initiation ritual" practiced in higher education institutions in the Indian subcontinent, including India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. The practise is similar to hazing in North America, bizutage in France, praxe in Portugal, and other similar practices in educational institutions across the world. Ragging involves abuse, humiliation, or harassment of new entrants or junior students by the senior students. It often takes a malignant form wherein the newcomers may be subjected to psychological or physical torture.
In 2009, the University Grants Commission of India imposed regulations upon Indian universities to help curb ragging and launched a toll-free 'anti-ragging helpline'.Ragging is a subset of bullying. Unlike various complex forms of bullying, ragging is easily recognisable.
According to University Grants Commission (India)â€™s anti-ragging cell data, 511 complaints of ragging were registered in India in 2021. Inaction and underreporting were cited as major causes of encouraging ragging. Medical colleges lead in ragging complaints, with most from the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh.
