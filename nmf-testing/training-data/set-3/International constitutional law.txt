International constitutional law is the study of constitutions in general, and combines aspects of constitutional law, public international law and legal theory. It adds international and transnational treaties to constitutional law. In federal states, subnational constitutions can also be identified. In this multi-level approach to constitutional law there are various relationships between constitutions (network of constitution law).
