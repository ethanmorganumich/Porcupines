Fuck-me shoes
||||||
Fuck-me shoes, alternatively fuck-me boots or fuck-me pumps, is a slang term for women's high-heeled shoes that exaggerate a sexual image. The term can be applied to any women's shoes that are worn with the intention of arousing others. It is sometimes used to imply condemnation against the women who choose to wear them or in a misogynistic fashion toward the women who wear them.The term is similar in meaning to kinky boots, although typically kinky boots refer more specifically to boots suited to a particular fetish.
