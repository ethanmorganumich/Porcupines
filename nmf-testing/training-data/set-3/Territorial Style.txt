Territorial Style
||||||
Territorial Style was an architectural style of building developed and used in Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico, popularized after the founding of Albuquerque in 1706. Reintroduced during the New Mexico Territory from the time of the Mexican and American territorial phases in 1821 until 1912, at which time New Mexico stopped being a territory and became a US state. Following the increase of its popularity in the 1930s and 1940s, it became referred to as the Territorial Revival style, which became another popular building style alongside New Mexico's Pueblo Revival style.
