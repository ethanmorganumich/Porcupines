Dato Capital
||||||
Dato Capital is an online database of business information about companies and directors registered in the United Kingdom, Gibraltar, Spain, Panama, Cayman Islands, Luxembourg and British Virgin Islands.
The website publishes basic company and director information but complete reports are priced. The amount of available information about a company varies depending on the country of incorporation, ranging from financial data (UK companies) to just company name and type (Cayman Islands and BVI). Basic information about directors includes approximate figures of the number and location of the companies involved and an extract of appointment list. Not all of the countries have director data.
The parent company who owns the database and website is Netamo Systems SL, incorporated in Spain.
The company received attention in October 2014 when it published lists of deleted director profile links under the Right to be forgotten directive.
