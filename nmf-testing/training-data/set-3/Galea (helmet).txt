Galea (helmet)
||||||
A galea ([ˈɡäɫ̪eä], from Greek γαλέη, galéē, "weasel, marten") was a Roman soldier's helmet. Some gladiators, specifically myrmillones, also wore bronze galeae with  face masks and decorations, often a fish on its crest. The exact form or design of the helmet varied significantly over time, between differing unit types, and also between individual examples – pre-industrial production was by hand – so it is not certain to what degree there was any standardization even under the Roman Empire.
Originally, Roman helmets were influenced by the neighboring Etruscans, people who utilised the "Nasua" type helmets. The Greeks in the south also influenced Roman design in its early history.
The primary evidence is scattered archaeological finds, which are often damaged or incomplete. There are similarities of form and function between them.
