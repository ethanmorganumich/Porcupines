Meitei architecture
||||||
Meitei architecture or Manipuri architecture is the architecture produced by the Meitei speaking people, whose culture flourished in the Kangleipak kingdom and its neighbouring kingdoms from the middle of the fifteenth century BC. 
The Meitei architecture is best known for its temples (Laishang, Kiyong, Thellon), found scattered in the Kangleipak (present day Manipur). Other architectural forms that are still in existence are the grand gates (Hojang), Traditional houses (Yumjao), Public houses (Sanglen), Official buildings (Loishang), etc.
