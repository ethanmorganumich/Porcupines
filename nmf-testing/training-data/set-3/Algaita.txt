The algaita (also spelled alghaita, algayta or algheita) is a double reed wind instrument from West Africa, especially among the Hausa and Kanuri peoples.  Its construction is similar to the oboe-like rhaita and the zurna.  The algaita is distinguished from these other instruments by its larger, trumpet-like bell.  Instead of keys, it has open holes for fingering, similar to the zurna.
