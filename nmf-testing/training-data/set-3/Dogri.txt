Dogri (Name Dogra Akkhar: 𑠖𑠵𑠌𑠤𑠮; Devanagari: डोगरी; Nastaliq: ڈوگری; IPA: [ɖoːɡɾiː]) is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken in the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir, India, with smaller groups of speakers in adjoining regions of western Himachal Pradesh, northern Punjab, and north-eastern Pakistani Punjab. It is the ethnic language of the Dogras, and is spoken in the historical region of Duggar. Dogri is a member of the Western Pahari group of languages. Unusually for an Indo-European language, Dogri is tonal, a trait it shares with other Western Pahari languages and Punjabi. It has several varieties, all with greater than 80% lexical similarity (within Jammu and Kashmir).
Dogri is spoken by 2.6 million people in India (as of the 2011 census). It has been among the country's 22 scheduled languages since 2003. It is also one of the 5 official languages of the union territory of Jammu and Kashmir.
