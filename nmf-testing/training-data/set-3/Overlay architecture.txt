Overlay architecture
||||||
Overlay architecture, or Overlay, is "event architecture", such as the temporary elements that are added to more permanent buildings to enable the operation of major sporting events or festivals. These elements provide additional facilities for the duration of an event and are generally of a lightweight construction, as they are often removed afterwards.
