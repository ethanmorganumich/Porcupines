The No Border Network (In the United Kingdom also called "No Borders Network" or "Noborders Network") refers to loose associations of autonomous organisations, groups, and individuals in Western Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe and beyond. They support freedom of movement and resist human migration control by coordinating international border camps, demonstrations, direct actions, and anti-deportation campaigns.
The Western European network opposes what it says are increasingly restrictive harmonisation of asylum and immigration policy in Europe, and aims to build alliances among migrant laborers and refugees. Common slogans used by the Network include; "No Border, No Nation, Stop Deportations!" and "No one is illegal."No Border Network has existed since 1999, and its website since 2000. The No Borders Network in the United Kingdom claims to have local groups in 11 cities.
