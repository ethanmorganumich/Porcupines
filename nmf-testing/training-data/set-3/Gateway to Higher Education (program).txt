Gateway to Higher Education (program)
||||||
The "Gateway Institute for Pre-College Education", begun as the Gateway to Higher Education program was started in New York City in September 1986.  Its initial goal was to prepare high school students from demographics underrepresented in science, medicine, and technology, for higher education in those fields.  Gateway relies on its strong partnerships with the public school system, medical centers, cultural institutions, universities and research facilities.  Based at City University at The City College of New York, the Gateway to Higher Education Program and the New York City Board of Education became partners in 1986 to increase the numbers of students from the public school system entering and completing medical school. The program began at five New York City high schools and has grown to nine programs within large high schools and three stand-alone schools.  In 2007, preparations were made to implement a similar program in Roxbury, Massachusetts, at the John D O'Bryant school, which was completing its third year as a Gateway Program (June 2009). It is onto its 5th year at John D. O'Bryant and has around 57 students enrolled in Fall of 2011. The head of the program, Ms. Bettie Nolan is working on making it better and trying to make sure every student in the program is getting the attention they need.
