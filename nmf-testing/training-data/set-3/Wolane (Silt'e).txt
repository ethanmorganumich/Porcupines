The Siltʼe people are an ethnic group in southern Ethiopia. They inhabit the Siltʼe Zone which is part of the Southern Nations, Nationalities and Peoples Region. Silt'e people speak Siltʼe language a Semitic language which is closely related to Wolane, Zay and Harari languages. Siltʼe denote their origin to the city of Harar and claim to be progenitors of the Hadiya Sultanate. One of the Silt'e people's ancestor was Hajji Aliye who accompanied Ahmed ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi's troops during the Ethiopian-Adal war in the sixteenth century. The last Garad of the Gan-Silte dynasty was Sediso K’albo before Menelik's forces invaded in the 1800s. Silte people were incorporated into Gurage region after their lands were annexed by Ethiopia, in the early 90s Silte obtained a separate zone following protests that the Gurage ethnic label was imposed on them.
