Quattrocento
||||||
The cultural and artistic events of Italy during the period 1400 to 1499 are collectively referred to as the  Quattrocento (UK: , US: , Italian: [ˌkwattroˈtʃɛnto]) from the Italian word for the number 400, in turn from millequattrocento, which is Italian for the year 1400. The Quattrocento encompasses the artistic styles of the late Middle Ages (most notably International Gothic), the early Renaissance (beginning around 1425), and the start of the High Renaissance, generally asserted to begin between 1495 and 1500.
