Reachability
||||||
In graph theory, reachability refers to the ability to get from one vertex to another within a graph. A vertex 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   can reach a vertex 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   (and 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   is reachable from 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  ) if there exists a sequence of adjacent vertices (i.e. a walk) which starts with 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   and ends with 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
  .
In an undirected graph, reachability between all pairs of vertices can be determined by identifying the connected components of the graph. Any pair of vertices in such a graph can reach each other if and only if they belong to the same connected component; therefore, in such a graph, reachability is symmetric (
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
   reaches 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   iff 
  
    
      
        t
      
    
    {\displaystyle t}
   reaches 
  
    
      
        s
      
    
    {\displaystyle s}
  ). The connected components of an undirected graph can be identified in linear time. The remainder of this article focuses on the more difficult problem of determining pairwise reachability in a directed graph (which, incidentally, need not be symmetric).
