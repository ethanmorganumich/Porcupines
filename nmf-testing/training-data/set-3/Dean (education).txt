Dean (education)

Dean is a title employed in academic administrations such as colleges or universities for a person with significant authority over a specific academic unit, over a specific area of concern, or both. In the United States and Canada, deans are usually the head of each constituent college and school that make up a university. Deans are common in private preparatory schools, and occasionally found in middle schools and high schools as well.
