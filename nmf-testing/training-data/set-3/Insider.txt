Business Insider

Insider, previously named Business Insider (BI), is an American financial and business news website founded in 2007. Since 2015, a majority stake in Business Insider's parent company Insider Inc. has been owned by the German publishing house Axel Springer. It operates several international editions, including one in the United Kingdom.
Insider publishes original reporting and aggregates material from other outlets. As of 2011, it maintained a liberal policy on the use of anonymous sources. It has also published native advertising and granted sponsors editorial control of its content. The outlet has been nominated for several awards, but is criticized for using factually incorrect clickbait headlines to attract viewership.
In 2015, Axel Springer SE acquired 88 percent of the stake in Insider Inc. for $343 million (â‚¬306 million), implying a total valuation of $442 million. In February 2021, the brand was renamed simply Insider.
