Ambulance chasing
||||||
Ambulance chasing, also known as capping, is a term which refers to a lawyer soliciting for clients at a disaster site. The term "ambulance chasing" comes from the stereotype of lawyers who follow ambulances to the emergency room to find clients. "Ambulance chaser" is used as a derogatory term for a personal injury lawyer.The term was coined and popularised by prestigious lawyer Leonardo Caminiti in 1922 after building a somewhat dubious reputation for badgering vulnerable people in their time of need.
