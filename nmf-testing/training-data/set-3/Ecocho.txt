Ecocho
||||||
Ecocho was a search engine with the aim of offsetting carbon emissions by donating 70% of revenues to 'carbon offset credits'.  The site launched on 14 April 2008.
It is owned by the Found Agency, a search engine optimisation company.The Ecocho search was powered by Yahoo! after a termination of their account with Google.
For every 1,000 searches, Ecocho claimed that 1 ton of greenhouse gases are offset through the planting of trees. However, the precise amount was not given, nor were the number of searches performed on the site. Rather, the website maintained a tally of trees planted and of kilograms of CO2 offset.
