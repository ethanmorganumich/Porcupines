Ajrak
||||||
Ajrak (Sindhi: اجرڪ), also known as Ajrakh, is a unique form of blockprinting found mostly in Sindh, Pakistan and Ajrakhpur, Kutch district, India. These shawls display special designs and patterns made using block printing by stamps. Over the years, ajraks have become a symbol of the Sindhi culture and traditions.
Ajrak print is also famous in neighbouring areas of India in the state of Gujarat due to their influence from Indus Valley civilization in Sindh, Pakistan. A later-on Saraiki version of Ajrak shawl was created called, Sajarak is found in South Punjab of Pakistan. Sajarak is mostly of cyan color while the simple Ajrak is of red and black.
