Kariyushi shirt
||||||
The Kariyushi shirt (かりゆしウェア, kariyushi wear) is a style of dress shirt originating in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan. Similar to aloha shirts, these shirts are mainly worn in summer. The shirts are printed, mostly short-sleeved, and collared. Kariyushi shirts may be worn as casual, informal wear, or as dresswear. First introduced in 1970 to promote tourism to Okinawa Prefecture, the style gained popularity in 2000 when heads of state wore them during the 26th G8 summit which was held in Okinawa. These shirts are promoted as part of the Cool Biz campaign by the Government of Japan.
