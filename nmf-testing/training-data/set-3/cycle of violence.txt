Cycle of violence
||||||
The term cycle of violence refers to repeated and dangerous acts of violence  as a cyclical pattern,  associated with high emotions and doctrines of retribution or revenge.  The pattern, or cycle, repeats and can happen many times during a relationship. Each phase may last a different length of time, and over time the level of violence may increase. The phrase has been increasingly widespread since first popularised in the 1970s.It often refers to violent behavior learned as a child, and then repeated as an adult, therefore continuing on in a perceived cycle.
