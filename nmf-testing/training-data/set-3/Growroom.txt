Growroom
||||||
A growroom (or grow room)  or growth chamber is a room of any size where plants are grown under controlled conditions.  The reasons for utilizing a growroom are countless.  Some seek to avoid the criminal repercussions of growing illicit cultivars, while others simply have no alternative to indoor growing. Plants can be grown with the use of grow lights, sunlight, or a combination of the two. Due to the heat generated by high power lamps, grow rooms will often become excessively hot relative to the temperature range ideal for plant growth, often necessitating the use of a supplemental ventilation fan.
