Output (economics)
||||||
Output in economics is the "quantity of goods or services produced in a given time period, by a firm, industry, or country", whether consumed or used for further production.
The concept of national output is essential in the field of macroeconomics. It is national output that makes a country rich, not large amounts of money.
