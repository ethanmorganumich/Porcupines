Mathematics education
||||||
In contemporary education, mathematics education – known on the European continent as the didactics or pedagogy of mathematics – is the practice of teaching, learning and carrying out scholarly research into subjects related to the transfer of mathematical knowledge.
Although research into mathematics education is primarily concerned with the tools, methods and approaches that facilitate practice or the study of practice, it also covers an extensive field of study encompassing a variety of different concepts, theories and methods. National and international organisations regularly hold conferences and publish literature in order to further human understanding of mathematics education.
