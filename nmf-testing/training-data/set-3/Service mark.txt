Service mark
||||||
A service mark or servicemark is a trademark used in the United States and several other countries to identify a service rather than a product.When a service mark is federally registered, the standard registration symbol ® or "Reg U.S. Pat & TM Off" may be used (the same symbol is used to mark registered trademarks).  Before it is registered, it is common practice (with some legal standing) to use the service mark symbol ℠ (a superscript SM).
