Bali Aga architecture
||||||
Bali Aga architecture refers to the architecture of the Bali Aga people, the mountain people of Bali, Indonesia. Compared to the lowland Balinese people, the relative isolation of the Bali Aga people meant that they have been less influenced by Hindu-Buddhist traditions. This separate history can be seen in the vernacular architecture of the Bali Aga which shows more similarity with the Austronesian tradition shared with many Indonesian people across the archipelago.
