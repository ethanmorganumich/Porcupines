Educational music,  is a genre of music in which songs, lyrics, or other musical elements are used as a method of teaching and/or learning. It has been shown in research to promote learning.[1][2] Additionally, music study in general has been shown to improve academic performance of students.[3][4][5]Music used for learning can be in many formats, including video recordings, audio recordings, sheet music, and improvised music. Most of the time, music is added to an existing lesson plan or story. Songs are usually easy to sing and catchy, so that they can be repeated for later learning. Some children's music is considered educational, and, historically, most educational music is geared towards children. Prominent examples include songs from LazyTown, Sesame Street, Schoolhouse Rock, Smart Songs' educational rap videos on YouTube, and Tom Lehrer's songs for the PBS show The Electric Company. Some educational songs also have become popular hits such as "Low Bridge (Fifteen Years/Miles On The Erie Canal)" and "The Battle Of New Orleans".
Recent developments have extended music's use to secondary and collegiate education, with Cornel West breaking new ground in this regard.[6]
