The President's Council on Service and Civic Participation was created by U.S. President George W. Bush  in January 2003 by executive order.  Its mission is to encourage volunteerism and to recognize the contributions Americans make through service and civic participation.

The Council was created to further this goal, encouraging Americans of all ages and backgrounds to become more engaged in civic activities. Council members provide leadership, serving as "Ambassadors of Service" for the President's vision of fostering a culture of citizenship and volunteer service in the United States.
The Council brings together leaders from the worlds of business, entertainment, sports, education, government, nonprofits, and the media.  The council was made up of the following individuals:
