Fraternities and sororities, also referred to as Greek-letter organizations (GLOs) or, collectively, as "Greek life" in North America and the Philippines, are social organizations at colleges and universities. A form of the social fraternity, they are prominent in Canada, the United States, Europe and the Philippines. Similar organizations exist in other countries, including the Studentenverbindungen of former and current German-speaking countries and the goliardie in Italy.
Similar, but much less common, organizations also exist for secondary school students, as do fraternal orders for other adults. In modern North American usage, "Greek letter organization" is often synonymous with the terms "fraternity" and "sorority". Two additional types of fraternities, professional fraternities and honor societies, incorporate some limited elements of traditional fraternity organization, but are generally considered a different type of association. Traditional fraternities of the type described in this article are often called "social fraternities".
Generally, membership in a fraternity or sorority is obtained as an undergraduate student but continues thereafter for life. Some of these organizations can accept graduate students as well as undergraduates, per constitutional provisions.Individual fraternities and sororities vary in organization and purpose, but most share five common elements:

Secrecy
Single-sex membership
Selection of new members on the basis of a two-part vetting and probationary process known as rushing and pledging
Ownership and occupancy of a residential property where undergraduate members live
A set of complex identification symbols that may include Greek letters, armorial achievements, ciphers, badges, grips, hand signs, passwords, flowers, and colorsFraternities and sororities engage in philanthropic activities, host parties, provide "finishing" training for new members such as instruction on etiquette, dress and manners, and create networking opportunities for their newly graduated members.
Fraternities and sororities can be tax-exempt 501(c)(7) organizations in the United States.
Fraternities and sororities have been widely criticized for practicing elitism and favoritism, discriminating against non-white students and other marginalized groups, conducting dangerous hazing rituals, and facilitating alcohol abuse. Fraternities specifically have been further criticized for encouraging misogynistic behavior and perpetrating sexual violence. Many colleges and universities have sought to reform or eliminate Greek life due to these concerns, but these efforts have typically been met with intense controversy. As one example, Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario has banned AMS members from joining externally-affiliated fraternities and sororities since 1933. While fraternities do exist in Kingston, they are prohibited from recruiting on-campus or affiliating themselves with the University.
