Summer architecture

Summer architecture (Portuguese: arquitetura de veraneio) was a Portuguese architectural movement originating in the Portuguese Riviera, in late 19th and early 20th century, when the region became a popular resort destination for the Portuguese Royal Family and the Portuguese aristocracy. The movement is not characterized by any single architectural style or artistic school, but rather unified by common themes, including leisure, wellness, exoticism, and heterotopia.The Portuguese Riviera, the coastal region west of the capital Lisbon centered on the cities of Cascais, Sintra, and Oeiras, became a resort destination in the 1870s when King Luís I of Portugal began spending his summers at the Palácio da Cidadela in Cascais. A development boom ensued along the coast, accompanied by the construction of the Cascais railway and the Sintra railway, resulting in the construction of palaces, estates, and chalets of Lisbon's aristocracy for use in the summer. The movement's proliferation in the Portuguese Riviera influenced architectural and stylistic tastes across Portugal's other coastal regions, namely Figueira da Foz and Foz do Douro.
