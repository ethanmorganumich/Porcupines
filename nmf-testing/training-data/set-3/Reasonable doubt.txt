Reasonable doubt
||||||
Beyond a reasonable doubt is a legal standard of proof required to validate a criminal conviction in most adversarial legal systems. It is a justifiably higher standard of proof than the balance of probabilities (which are commonly used in civil cases), because the stakes are much higher in a criminal case: a person could be deprived of liberty, or in extreme cases, life, as well as suffer the collateral consequences and social stigma attached to a conviction should they be found guilty. As such, the prosecution is tasked with discharging this burden in order to get a conviction; failure to do so entitles the accused to an acquittal. Beyond a reasonable doubt is widely accepted in many criminal justice systems, and its origin can be traced to Blackstone's ratio, "It is better that ten guilty persons escape than that one innocent suffer." 
Because a defendant is presumed to be innocent, the prosecution has the burden of proving their guilt on every element of the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt. This means that in order to overcome such presumption and get a conviction, the prosecution must adduce compelling evidence that leaves no real doubt in the mind of the trier of fact (the judge or jury) that the defendant is almost certainly guilty. For any reasonable doubt to exist, it must come from insufficient evidence or conflict on the evidence that leaves an impartial factfinder less than fully satisfied or entirely convinced of the defendant's guilt. Accordingly, the standard of proof forces the factfinder to ignore unreasonable doubts—doubts that are frivolous, hypothetical, or not logically linked to the evidence—as well as duly consider evidence favoring the accused, for any shred of reasonable doubt entitles them to an acquittal.  
The term reasonable doubt can be criticised for having a circular definition. Therefore, jurisdictions using this standard often rely on additional or supplemental measures, such as a judge's specific instructions to a jury, to simplify or qualify reasonable doubt. Legal systems have tended to avoid quantifying the reasonable doubt standard (for example, as "over 90% probability"), although legal scholars from a variety of analytical perspectives have argued in favor of quantification of the criminal standard of proof.Medieval Roman law, followed by the English jurist Edward Coke, expressed a similar idea by requiring "proofs clearer than light" for criminal conviction. The formulation "beyond reasonable doubt" is characteristic of Anglophone legal systems since the eighteenth century.
