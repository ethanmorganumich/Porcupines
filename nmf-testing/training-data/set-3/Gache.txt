Gache
||||||
The gache (Korean: 가체; Hanja: 加髢) is a traditional Korean wig worn by women. Historically, gache were expensive accessories worn only by women of high social standing, alongside kisaeng. They were decorated with silk objects, gold, jewels, silver, coral, jade, and other expensive materials. Certain decorations were reserved for royalty.
Inclusive of its decorations, a gache usually weighs around 3–4 kilograms (6.6–8.8 lb).
