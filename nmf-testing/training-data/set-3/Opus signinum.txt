Opus signinum ('cocciopesto' in modern Italian) is a building material used in ancient Rome. It is  made of tiles broken up into very small pieces, mixed with mortar, and then beaten down with a rammer. Pliny the Elder in his Natural History describes its manufacture: "Even broken pottery has been utilized; it being found that, beaten to powder, and tempered with lime, it becomes more solid and durable than other substances of a similar nature; forming the cement known as the "Signine" composition, so extensively employed for even making the pavements of houses." Pliny's use of the term "signine" references "Signia (modern Segni), the name of a town in Latium which was famous for its tiles."
