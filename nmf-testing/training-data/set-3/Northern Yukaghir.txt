||||||
The Tundra Yukaghir language (also known as Northern Yukaghir; self-designation: Вадул аруу (Wadul aruu)) is one of only two extant Yukaghir languages.
Last spoken in the tundra belt extending between the lower Indigirka to the lower Kolyma basin (69°N 154°E), Tundra Yukaghir was formerly spoken in a much wider area extending west to the Lena basin.
