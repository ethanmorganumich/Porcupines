Second breakfast (or German: zweites Frühstück, Polish: drugie śniadanie, Slovak: desiata, Spanish: almuerzo, Hungarian: tízórai) is a meal eaten after breakfast, but before lunch. It is a traditional meal in Bavaria, Poland, Slovakia, Spain and Hungary. In Bavaria and Poland, special dishes are made exclusively to be eaten during second breakfast. In Vienna and most other parts of Austria the second breakfast is referred to as Jause. In other Spanish-speaking countries, almuerzo means lunch, but in Spain it is a second breakfast. It is typical to eat four to five meals a day in these locations.
