Banbi (Chinese: 半臂; lit. 'half-arm'), also known as banxiu (Chinese: 半袖; lit. 'half-sleeves') and sometimes referred as beizi (Chinese: 褙子) or half-beizi (i.e. short-sleeved beizi) before the term beizi eventually came to refer to a long-sleeved beizi in the Song dynasty, and referred as dahu in the Yuan dynasty, is an upper garment item in Hanfu. The banbi is in the form of a waistcoat or outerwear with short sleeves, which could either be worn over or under a long-sleeved ruqun. The style of its collar varies; it can also be secured at the front either with ties or a metal button.
