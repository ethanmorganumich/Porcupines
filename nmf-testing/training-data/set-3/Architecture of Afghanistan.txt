Architecture of Afghanistan
||||||
The architecture of Afghanistan refers to architecture within the borders defining the modern country, with these remaining relatively unchanged since 1834. As the connection between the three major cultural and geographic centres of Central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Iranian plateau, the boundaries of the region prior to this time changed with the rapid advancement of armies, with the land belonging to a vast range of empires over the last two millennia.The diversity of Afghan history allows for the diversity that exists in the country's architecture and architectural remains, with influences ranging over time from Greek to Persian to Indian to Chinese and European in recent centuries. A range of religious influences over time are also reflected, with evidence primarily exhibiting early Buddhist, Zoroastrian and Islamic inspiration.
