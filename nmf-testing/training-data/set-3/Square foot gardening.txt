Square foot gardening
||||||
Square foot gardening is the practice of dividing the growing area into small square sections, typically 1 foot (30 cm) on a side, hence the name.  The aim is to assist the planning and creating of a small but intensively planted vegetable garden.  It results in a simple and orderly gardening system, from which it draws much of its appeal.  Mel Bartholomew coined the term "square foot gardening" in his 1981 book of the same name.
