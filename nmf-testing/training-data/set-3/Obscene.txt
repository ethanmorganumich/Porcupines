Obscenity
||||||
An obscenity is any utterance or act that strongly offends the prevalent morality of the time. It is derived from the Latin obscÄ“nus, obscaenus, "boding ill; disgusting; indecent", of uncertain etymology. Such loaded language can be used to indicate strong moral repugnance and outrage, in expressions such as "obscene profits" and "the obscenity of war".  As a legal term, it usually refers to graphic depictions of people engaged in sexual and excretory activity, and related utterances of profane speech.
