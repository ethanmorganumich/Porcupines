Life estate
||||||
In common law and statutory law, a life estate (or life tenancy) is the ownership of immovable property for the duration of a person's life.  In legal terms, it is an estate in real property that ends at death when ownership of the property may revert to the original owner, or it may pass to another person.  The owner of a life estate is called a "life tenant".
In the combined jurisdiction of England and Wales since 1925 a freehold estate intended to be 'held' as a life interest takes effect only as an interest enjoyed in equity, specifically as an interest in possession trust.  The other type of land ownership is leasehold and although most long leases are for a period of between 99 and 999 years 'leases for life' will be interpreted in often unpredictable ways as either as a licence or a lease.
