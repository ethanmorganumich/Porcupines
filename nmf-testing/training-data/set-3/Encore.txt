Encore
||||||
An encore is an additional performance given by performers after the planned show has ended, usually in response to extended applause from the audience. Multiple encores are not uncommon, and they initially originated spontaneously, when audiences continued to applaud and demand additional performance from the artists after they had left the stage. However, in modern times they are rarely spontaneous and are usually a pre-planned part of the show.
