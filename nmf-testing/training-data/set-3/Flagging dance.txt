Flagging dance

Flagging dance is a performing art form often called "Flag Dancing", "Spin Flagging", "Flow Flagging", "Color Guard" and "Rag Spinning", but more commonly referred to as "Flagging". Specifically, flagging dance is the undulation, spinning and waving of flags in a rhythmic fashion with music. Practitioners of this form of performance art and dance are usually referred to as "Flaggers" and "Flag Dancers."
Although spinning Flags resembles the spinning of Poi, it is not a form of Poi. Poi originated with the MƒÅori people of New Zealand while Flagging derived from Gay culture. Both developed independently from each other. The exact origins of Flagging are unclear, but it is thought to have started in gay clubs in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Flagging was borne from the use of Oriental Hand Fans and the handkerchiefs from the Hanky Code. These two props were used as antagonist to aromatize, using the handkerchiefs. Then dearomatized, using the  Oriental Hand Fans on the dance floors to diffuse amyl nitrate (poppers). Combining the two moves made from Fan Dancing and the handkerchiefs, with coins stitched in a corner acting as a lead, Flag Dancing developed. 
This art form was almost lost to culture death due to the HIV/AIDS crisis in the early 1980s, when many talented members in the gay community were lost. A resurgence of Flagging started gaining ground in the early 90's at Circuit Parties and T-Dances. Today, Flagging can be seen at events such as Pride Parade, Flagging in the Park, EDM ( Electric Dance Music) Music Festivals, in the 2011 released documentary Flow Affair director Wolfgang Busch and recently in some Christian churches, where the Flags are called Worship Flags. The difference between Worship Flags and Spin/Flow Flags is the lead. Worship Flags use a rod or Dowl, Spin/Flow Flags have a lead beaded weighted curtain cord.
