Video clips refer to mostly short videos, most of the time called memes, which are short videos of silly jokes and funny clips, most of the time coming from movies or any entertainment videos like YouTube in general. The term is also used more loosely to mean any video program, including a full program, uploaded onto a website or other medium.
