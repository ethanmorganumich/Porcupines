Mexican pointy boots
||||||
Mexican pointy boots (Spanish: Botas picudas mexicanas) or tribal boots (Spanish: botas tribaleras) are a style of pointed fashion boots made with elongated toes that were a popular footwear for men in parts of Mexico. The boots were commonly worn in an ironic and comedic way by males involved in the trival music subculture that thrived in the early 2010s.
It is said that these boots originated in the city of Monterrey in the Mexican state of Nuevo León. The pointy boots have risen to popularity at the same time as "trance music" and the boots have become a preferred footwear for the all-male troupes that dance to the electronic music.
