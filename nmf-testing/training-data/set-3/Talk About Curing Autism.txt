The Autism Community in Action (TACA) (formerly known as Talk About Curing Autism)  is a nonprofit organization founded in 2000 by Lisa Ackerman and based in Irvine, California. The mission statement is "TACA provides education, support and hope to families living with autism."TACA Programming includes Parent Education and Support through Chapter Meetings & Coffee Talks Education Events, Autism Journey Guides Website & Support Hotline Community Events Parent Mentoring National Conferences in California and Georgia Webinars and online parent education.TACA is frequently at odds with the scientific consensus about autism's causes and treatments, with various spokespeople for the group having publicly indicated support for Andrew Wakefield, author of a fraudulent research paper linking vaccines and autism.
Group founder Lisa Ackerman used to attribute autism to a wide range of causes, urging parents to get rid of flame-retardant clothing or mattresses and new carpeting. She advocated for vitamin shots and hyperbaric oxygen chamber treatments.
