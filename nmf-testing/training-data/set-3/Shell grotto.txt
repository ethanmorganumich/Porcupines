Shell grotto
||||||
A shell grotto is a type of folly, a grotto decorated with sea shells.  The shell grotto was a popular feature of many British country houses in the 17th and 18th centuries.  It suited the Baroque and Rococo styles (which used swirling motifs similar to sea shells) and often represented the mimicry of architectural features from the Italian Renaissance (themselves copies from Classical times).  The idea of a grotto was originally a means to enhance a dank undercroft, or provide an antechamber before a piano nobile, but later it became a garden feature independent of the house, sometimes on the edge of a lake, with water flowing through it.
