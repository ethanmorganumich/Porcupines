Upright and Wing, also referred to as Temple and Wing or Gable Front and Wing, is a residential architectural style found in American vernacular architecture. It was popular from the mid- to late 19th century and is typified by a gable ended "upright" section, usually two stories, and a one-story ell or "wing" section.
