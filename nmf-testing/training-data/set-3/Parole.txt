Parole

Parole (also known as provisional release or supervised release) is a form of early release of a prison inmate where the prisoner agrees to abide by certain behavioral conditions, including checking-in with their designated parole officers, or else they may be rearrested and returned to prison.

 
Originating from the French word parole ("speech, spoken words" but also "promise"), the term became associated during the Middle Ages with the release of prisoners who gave their word.
This differs greatly from pardon, amnesty or commutation of sentence in that parolees are  still considered to be serving their sentences, and may be returned to prison if they violate the conditions of their parole.
