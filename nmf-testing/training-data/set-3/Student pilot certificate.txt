Student pilot certificate
||||||
In the United States, a student pilot certificate is issued to a pilot in training, and is a pre-requisite for the student to fly alone in the aircraft, or solo. 
A medical certificate is required, which is issued directly by the AME. Prior to April 1, 2016, it could be issued by a medical doctor who is also an authorized aviation medical examiner (AME), in conjunction with the student's first medical certificate. Although the classification of the medical does not matter, it is suggested that the student get a first-class medical to know if they can pass the more difficult tests. 
The student takes the certificate to their instructor, who then completes an application. All applications are completed online through the Integrated Airman Certification and Rating Application (IACRA) on the Federal Aviation Administration's online portal. The student pilot is to fill out the form and have their instructor check all forms before submission. The student must fill it out, then the instructor does a portion, and the cycle repeats. The completed application is sent to the FAA, which will send the student pilot certificate to the student. A temporary certificate is available after the form has been approved, usually approximately two weeks after submission. This temporary paper can be used during the actual solo flight until the physical card arrives in the mail. Although this student pilot certificate does not always come right before a solo flight, it is required, and thus earning a student pilot certificate is a sign that a solo flight may be near.
