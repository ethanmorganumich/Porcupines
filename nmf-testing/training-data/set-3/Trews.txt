Trews (Truis or Triubhas) are men's clothing for the legs and lower abdomen, a traditional form of tartan trousers from Scottish Highland dress.  Trews could be trimmed with leather, usually buckskin, especially on the inner leg to prevent wear from riding on horseback.
Tartan trews shared the fate of other items of Highland dress, including proscription under  the Dress Act of 1746 that banned men and boys from wearing the truis ("Trowse") outside of military service. The Dress Act lasted until 1782 when it was repealed under the reign of King George III.
