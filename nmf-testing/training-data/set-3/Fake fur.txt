Fake fur
||||||
Fake fur, also called faux fur, is a pile fabric engineered to have the appearance and warmth of animal fur.
It was first introduced on the market in 1929 using hair from the South American alpaca. The quality of fake furs was greatly improved in the 1940s by advances in textile manufacture. Modern fake furs were developed in the mid-1950s, with acrylic polymers replacing alpaca hair.The promotion of fake furs by animal rights and animal welfare organizations has contributed to its increasing popularity as an animal-friendly alternative to traditional fur clothing.
