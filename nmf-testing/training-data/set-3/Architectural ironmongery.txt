Architectural ironmongery or architectural hardware is a term used for the manufacture and wholesale distribution of items made from iron, steel, brass, aluminium or other metals, including plastics, for use in all types of buildings. Architectural ironmongery includes door handles, closers, locks, cylinder pulls and hinges (door furniture), window fittings, cupboard fittings, iron railings, handrails, balustrades, switches and sockets.
The term is sometimes used to distinguish between these items and retail of consumer goods sold in ironmongers' shops or hardware stores.
