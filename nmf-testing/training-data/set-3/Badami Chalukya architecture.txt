Badami Chalukya architecture
||||||
Badami Chalukya architecture is a style in Hindu temple architecture that evolved in the 5th â€“ 8th centuries CE in the Malaprabha river basin, in the present-day Bagalkot district of Karnataka state of India, under the Chalukya dynasty; later it spread more widely. This style is sometimes called the Vesara style and Chalukya style, a term that also includes the much later Western Chalukya architecture of the 11th and 12th centuries.  Early Chalukya architecture, used by George Michell and others, equates to Badami Chalukya.  
The earliest Badami Chalukya temples date back to around 450 in Aihole when the Badami Chalukyas were vassals of the Kadambas of Banavasi. The Early Chalukya style was perfected in Badami and Pattadakal, both in Karnataka. 
The unknown architects and artists experimented with different styles, blended the Nagara and Dravidian styles.  The style includes two types of monuments: rock cut halls or "cave temples", and "structural" temples, built above ground.
