Heather (fabric)
||||||
In clothing, heather refers to a color effect created by mixing two or more different colored fibers or yarns. It is interwoven yarns of mixed colors, and possibly the type of fiber, producing another color.  It is typically used to mix multiple shades of grey or grey with another color to produce a muted shade (e.g., heather green), but any two colors can be mixed, including bright colors. A mixed fabric color is achieved by using different colors of fiber and mixing them together (a good example is a grey heather t-shirt). Black and white fiber mixed will combine to give grey heather fiber. Heather is blended fibers combined to create a multicolored effect. Heather effect is also known as melange effect.
