Dyke march
||||||
A dyke march is a lesbian visibility and protest march, much like the original Gay Pride parades and gay rights demonstrations. The main purpose of a dyke march is the encouragement of activism within the lesbian community. Dyke marches commonly take place the Friday or Saturday before LGBT pride parades. Larger metropolitan areas usually have several Pride-related happenings (including picnics, workshops, arts festivals, parties, benefits, dances, and bar events) both before and after the march to further community building; with social outreach to specific segments such as older women, women of color, and lesbian parenting groups.
In North America, dyke marches are now held in the boroughs of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens in New York City; Asbury Park, New Jersey; as well as Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Long Beach,  Minneapolis,  Oakland, Philadelphia,  Pittsburgh, Portland (Maine), Portland (Oregon), San Diego, San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, DC, and  West Hollywood in the United States; and Calgary, Halifax, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg in Canada. In Europe, dyke marches take place in Berlin and London.
