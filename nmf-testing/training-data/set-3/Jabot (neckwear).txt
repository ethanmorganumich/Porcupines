Jabot (neckwear)
||||||
A jabot ( (listen); from French jabot: a bird's crop) is a decorative clothing-accessory consisting of lace or other fabric falling from the throat, suspended from or attached to a neckband or collar, or simply pinned at the throat. Its current form evolved from the frilling or ruffles decorating the front of a shirt in the 19th century.
