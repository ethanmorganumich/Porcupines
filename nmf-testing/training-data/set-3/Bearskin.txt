Bearskin
||||||
A bearskin is a tall fur cap, usually worn as part of a ceremonial military uniform.  Traditionally, the bearskin was the headgear of grenadiers, and remains in use by grenadier and guards regiments in various armies.
Bearskins should not be confused with other types of fur military headdresses, notably the smaller busby.
