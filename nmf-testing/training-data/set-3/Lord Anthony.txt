Lord Anthony
||||||
Lord Anthony was a brand of clothing particularly popular in the UK during the 1970s and 1980s.  They made a variety of clothing including shirts, jumpers, trousers, gilets and jackets, however by far their most popular item was their snorkel parka.  It became so popular that people would often refer to it as a "a Lord Anthony" rather than a "parka" or "anorak". It became a school playground legend and even the subject of a song by Belle & Sebastian on the album Dear Catastrophe Waitress.
