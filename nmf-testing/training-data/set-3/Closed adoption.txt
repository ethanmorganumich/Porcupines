Closed adoption
||||||
Closed adoption (also called "confidential" adoption and sometimes "secret" adoption) is a process by which an infant is adopted by another family, and the record of the biological parent(s) is kept sealed. Often, the biological father is not recordedâ€”even on the original birth certificate.  An adoption of an older child who already knows his or her biological parent(s) cannot be made closed or secret.  This used to be the most traditional and popular type of adoption, peaking in the decades of the post-World War II Baby Scoop Era. It still exists today, but it exists alongside the practice of open adoption.  The sealed records effectively prevent the adoptee and the biological parents from finding, or even knowing anything about each other  (especially in the days before the Internet). However, the emergence of non-profit organizations and private companies to assist individuals with their sealed records has been effective in helping people who want to connect with biological relatives to do so.
