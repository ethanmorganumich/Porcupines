Self-cleaning floor
||||||
A self-cleaning floor is a floor surface that reduces the amount of chemicals needed by absorbing into itself through special pods automated to dispose of the water four times a day. Such floors are meant for use in hospitals, washrooms and other places. In Europe, many leading ceramic tiles and sanitary ware manufacturers have products on the market with self cleaning features.
