Karakul (hat)
||||||
A Karakul hat (Dari/Urdu/Pashto/Uzbek/Kashmiri: قراقلی), sometimes spelled as Qaraqul hat, also called Jinnah Cap and Uzbek hat is a hat made from the fur of the Qaraqul breed of sheep. Karakul directly translates to black fur in the Uzbek language and the hat originally comes from Bukhara. The fur from which it is made is referred to as Astrakhan, broadtail, qaraqulcha, or Persian lamb. The hat is peaked, and folds flat when taken off of the wearer's head.
The cap is typically worn by men in Central and South Asia. It was worn by , Amanullah Khan, the former king of Afghanistan and Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan. The karakul, which had distinguished all educated urban men since the beginning of the 20th century, has fallen out of fashion in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
