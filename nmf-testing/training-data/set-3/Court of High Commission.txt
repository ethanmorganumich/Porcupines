Court of High Commission
||||||
The Court of High Commission was the supreme ecclesiastical court in England. Some of its powers was to take action against conspiracies, plays, tales, contempts, false rumors, books. It was instituted by the crown in 1559 to enforce the Acts of Uniformity and Supremacy. John Whitgift, the Archbishop of Canterbury, obtained increased powers for the Court by the 1580s. He proposed and had passed the Seditious Sectaries Act 1593, thus making Puritanism an offence. The Court reached the height of its powers during the Reformation and was finally dissolved by the Long Parliament in 1641.  The court was convened at will by the sovereign, and had near unlimited power over civil as well as church matters. There were also Scottish Courts of High Commission which vied with the General Assembly and lower church courts for authority.
