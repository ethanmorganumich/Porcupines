Dinic's algorithm or Dinitz's algorithm is a strongly polynomial algorithm for computing the maximum flow in a flow network, conceived in 1970 by Israeli (formerly Soviet) computer scientist Yefim (Chaim) A. Dinitz. The algorithm runs in 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          V
          
            2
          
        
        E
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(V^{2}E)}
   time and is similar to the Edmondsâ€“Karp algorithm, which runs in 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        V
        
          E
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(VE^{2})}
   time, in that it uses shortest augmenting paths. The introduction of the concepts of the level graph and blocking flow enable Dinic's algorithm to achieve its performance.
