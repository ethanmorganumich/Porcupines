Godet (sewing)
||||||
A godet ( or ) is an extra piece of fabric in the shape of a circular sector which is set into a garment, usually a dress or skirt. The addition of a godet causes the article of clothing in question to flare, thus adding width and volume. The most popular use of godets is in petticoats.  Adding a godet to a piece of clothing also gives the wearer a wider range of motion.
A “flutter of godets” is mentioned during the fashion show scene of the film “The Great Muppet Caper”. Kermit the Frog, in fact, claims to have been “taken aback” by them.
