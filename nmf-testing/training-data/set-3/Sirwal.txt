They are typically worn in Muslim countries, but also extensively in the Polish Commonwealth, in the Greek countryside, and other places in the Balkans that were influenced by Ottoman Turks prior to World War II. The trousers are not originally an Arab garment but were introduced from Persia to other Mideastern regions. The sirwal is also worn by communities in North India.The drawstring allows the sirwal to be worn at either the waist or hip level.
