||||||
Pheta (Marathi: फेटा) is the Marathi name for the distinctive traditional turban worn in Maharashtra, India.In ceremonies such as weddings, as well as festive, cultural, and religious celebration, it is common to wear Pheta. In many areas it is customary to offer male dignitaries a traditional welcome by offering them a Pheta to wear. A traditional Pheta is usually long cloth typically 3.5 to 6 metres (11 to 20 feet) long and 1 metre (3 feet 3 inches) wide. The choice of colour may indicate the occasion for which it is being worn and also may be typical to the place it is being worn in. Typical colours include Saffron (to indicate valour) and White (to indicate peace). In the past, wearing a Pheta was considered a mandatory part of clothing.
