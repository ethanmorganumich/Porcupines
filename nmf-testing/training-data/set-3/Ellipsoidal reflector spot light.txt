Ellipsoidal reflector spotlight
||||||
Ellipsoidal reflector spot (abbreviated to ERS, or colloquially ellipsoidal or ellipse)  is the name for a type of stage lighting instrument, named for the ellipsoidal reflector used to collect and direct the light  through a barrel that contains a lens or lens train. The optics of an ERS instrument are roughly similar to those of a 35 mm slide projector. There are many types of ERS that are designed for the myriad applications found in the entertainment industry. ERS instruments come in all shapes and sizes. Each particular model of ERS has its own set of characteristics. Generally, ERS instruments are the most varied and utilized type of stage lighting instrument. ERS may also be referred to as Profile Spotlights (especially in Europe) because the beam can be shaped to the profile of an object.  Ellipsoidal reflectors are used for their strong, well-defined light and their versatility. Leko and Source Four are brand names which are often, but inaccurately, used to refer to any sort of ellipsoidal.
Characteristics of a typical ellipsoidal lighting unit include:

An ellipsoidal reflector
An adjustable lens tube containing the lens or lens train. Adjusting the tube by pushing it further in or pulling it further out of the unit allows changes to the focus (softness or hardness) of the beam of light projected by the unit. This results from changing the distance between the reflector and the lens train. "Zoom" ERS instruments can vary the size of beam as well as the focus
One or two Plano-Convex (PC for short) lenses within the lens tube to create the lens train.  The Plano-Convex lenses, named for having one flat side and one convex (bowed out) side, have their convex sides facing each other within the tube. The distance between these lenses and the distance between them and the reflector determines how wide the output beam of light is
A set of brackets on the end of the lens tube for the insertion of gel frames, a color changing unit or any variety of accessories.  Most modern units include two slots that allow for combining different accessories
A series of four shutters mounted at the internal focal point (the place where the varying angles of light coming off the reflector meet) of the unit.  These allow for precise shaping and sizing of the unit's beam as lines.  Additionally, an iris may be present to size the beam circularly.
A slot in the body of the unit for the insertion of metal gobos to change the pattern of the light in most cases is present, this slot can also hold a glass gobo, dichroic colour roundel or an effects unit such as a gobo rotator or iris.The lamps are loaded from the rear (in most cases), and either mounted axially, or radially with the base either up or down (the orientation is important when mounting the instrument as using the light upside down will shorten lamp life) at a 45-degree angle or sometimes at a 90-degree angle. The filament of the lamp is at one focal point of the ellipsoidal reflector and the gate with the shutters and gobo are at the other focal point.
