Double variation
||||||
The double variation (also known as alternating variations) is a musical form used in classical music.  It is a type of theme and variations that employs two themes.  In a double variation set, a first theme (to be called A here) is followed by a  second theme (B), followed by a variation on A, then a variation on B, and so on with alternating A and B variations.  Often there is a coda at the end.
The double variation is strongly associated with the composer Joseph Haydn, who wrote many such movements during his career.
