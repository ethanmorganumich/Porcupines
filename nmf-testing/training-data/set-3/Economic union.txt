Economic union
||||||
An economic union is a type of trade bloc which is composed of a common market with a customs union. The participant countries have both common policies on product regulation, freedom of movement of  goods, services and the factors of production (capital and labour) and a common external trade policy.   When an economic union involves unifying currency it becomes an economic and monetary union.
Purposes for establishing an economic union normally include increasing economic efficiency and establishing closer political and cultural ties between the member countries.
Economic union is established through trade pact.
