Urban castle

An urban castle (German: Stadtburg) is a castle that is located within a medieval town or city or is integrated into its fortifications. 
In most cases, the town or city grew up around or alongside the castle (for example in Halle, Brunswick and Prague), or the castle was built in order to reinforce the defences within or as part of the line of fortification ringing the settlement as, for example, at Erfurt.
