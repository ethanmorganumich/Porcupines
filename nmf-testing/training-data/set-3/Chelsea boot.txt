Chelsea boot
||||||
Chelsea boots are close-fitting, ankle-high boots with an elastic side panel. They often have a loop or tab of fabric on the back of the boot, enabling the boot to be pulled on. The boot dates back to the Victorian era, when it was worn by both men and women.
Chelsea boots and some of their variants were considered an iconic element of the 1960s in Britain, particularly the mod scene.
