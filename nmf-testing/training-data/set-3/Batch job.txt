Batch processing
||||||
Computerized batch processing is a method of running software programs called jobs in batches automatically. While users are required to submit the jobs, no other interaction by the user is required to process the batch.  Batches may automatically be run at scheduled times as well as being run contingent on the availability of computer resources.
