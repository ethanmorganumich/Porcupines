Camera angle
||||||
The camera angle marks the specific location at which the movie camera or video camera is placed to take a shot.  A scene may be shot from several camera angles simultaneously. This will give a different experience and sometimes emotion. The different camera angles will have different effects on the viewer and how they perceive the scene that is shot. There are a few different routes that a camera operator could take to achieve this effect.
