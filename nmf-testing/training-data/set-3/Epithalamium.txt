Epithalamium
||||||
An epithalamium (; Latin form of Greek ἐπιθαλάμιον epithalamion from ἐπί epi "upon," and θάλαμος thalamos nuptial chamber) is a poem written specifically for the bride on the way to her marital chamber. This form continued in popularity through the history of the classical world; the Roman poet Catullus wrote a famous epithalamium, which was translated from or at least inspired by a now-lost work of Sappho.  According to Origen, the Song of Songs might be an epithalamium on the marriage of Solomon with Pharaoh's daughter.
