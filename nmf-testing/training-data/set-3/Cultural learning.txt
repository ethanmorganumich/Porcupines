Cultural learning

Cultural learning is the way a group of people or animals within a society or culture tend to learn and pass on information. Learning styles are greatly influenced by how a culture socializes with its children and young people.  Cross-cultural research in the past fifty years has primarily focused on differences between Eastern and Western cultures.   Some scholars believe that cultural learning differences may be responses to the physical environment in the areas in which a culture was initially founded.   These environmental differences include climate, migration patterns, war, agricultural suitability, and endemic pathogens.  Cultural evolution, upon which cultural learning is built, is believed to be a product of only the past 10,000 years and to hold little connection to genetics.
