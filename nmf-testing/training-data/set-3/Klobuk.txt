||||||
A klobuk is an item of monastic clothing worn by monks and, in the Russian tradition, also by nuns, in the Byzantine Rite, composed of a kamilavka (stiffened round black headcovering) with an epanokamelavkion, a veil which completely covers the kamilavka and hangs down over the shoulders and back.
