Montefortino helmet
||||||
The Montefortino helmet was a type of Celtic, and later Roman, military helmet used from around 300 BC through the 1st century AD with continuing modifications. This helmet type is named after the region of Montefortino (frazione of Arcevia) in Italy, where a Montefortino helmet was first uncovered in a Celtic burial. (see the original one)
