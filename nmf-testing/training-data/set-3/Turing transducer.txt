Finite-state transducer
||||||
A finite-state transducer (FST) is a finite-state machine with two memory tapes, following the terminology for Turing machines: an input tape and an output tape. This contrasts with an ordinary finite-state automaton, which has a single tape.  An FST is a type of finite-state automaton (FSA) that maps between two sets of symbols.  An FST is more general than an FSA.  An FSA defines a formal language by defining a set of accepted strings, while an FST defines relations between sets of strings.
An FST will read a set of strings on the input tape and generates a set of relations on the output tape.  An FST can be thought of as a translator or relater between strings in a set.
In morphological parsing, an example would be inputting a string of letters into the FST, the FST would then output a string of morphemes.
