Patriotism is the feeling of love, devotion, and sense of attachment to one's country. This attachment can be a combination of many different feelings, language relating to one's own homeland, including ethnic, cultural, political or historical aspects. It encompasses a set of concepts closely related to nationalism, mostly civic nationalism and sometimes cultural nationalism.Some manifestations of patriotism emphasize the "land" element in love for one's native land and use the symbolism of agriculture and the soil â€“ compare Blut und Boden.
