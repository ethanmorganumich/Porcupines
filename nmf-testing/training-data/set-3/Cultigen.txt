Cultigen
||||||
A cultigen (from Latin  cultus 'cultivated', and  gens 'kind') or cultivated plant is a plant that has been deliberately altered or selected by humans; it is the result of artificial selection. These  plants, for the most part, have commercial value in horticulture, agriculture or forestry. Because cultigens are defined by their mode of origin and not by where they are growing, plants meeting this definition remain cultigens whether they are naturalised in the wild, deliberately planted in the wild, or growing in cultivation.
Cultigens arise in the following ways: 

selections of variants from the wild or cultivation including vegetative sports (aberrant growth that can be reproduced reliably in cultivation)
plants that are the result of plant breeding and selection programs
genetically modified plants (plants modified by the deliberate implantation of genetic material)
graft-chimaeras (plants grafted to produce mixed tissue, the graft material possibly from wild plants, special selections, or hybrids).
