Activism has played an important role in the history of Ohio Wesleyan University; The founders of Ohio Wesleyan University expressed a hope that the university "is forever to be conducted on the most liberal principles." OWU has espoused activism in its academic philosophy. Alumni of the school have prominently engaged in controversial issues of their times on three central issuesâ€”the scope of justice; distributive justice based on race, gender, and income; and institutions related to preserving social structures.
