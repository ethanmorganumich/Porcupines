The Gula Iro language (autonym kùláál) is a Bua language spoken by some 3,500 people (in 1991) north and east of Lake Iro in southern Chad, between the Bola and Salamat rivers.  It has four dialects, according to Pairault:

páṭóól (350 speakers), the northernmost and the least comprehensible to speakers of the other dialects, spoken in and around Badi;
pòŋààl (2,000 speakers), by the north shore of the lake, spoken in and around Boum Kabir, Boum Sarher, and Tordjigel;
tɩ́ààlà (730 speakers), spoken east and south of the lake, including Kouré, Bouni, Tormorhal, and Masidjanga;
tííṭààl (200 speakers), the easternmost, spoken in various villages west of Tamba;to which Ethnologue adds a fifth, Korintal (170 speakers), spoken in Tieou.Gula Iro is very closely related to Zan Gula and Bon Gula, but they are not mutually comprehensible.
