K shortest path routing
||||||
The k shortest path routing problem is a generalization of the shortest path routing problem in a given network. It asks not only about a shortest path but also about next kâˆ’1 shortest paths (which may be longer than the shortest path). A variation of the problem is the loopless k shortest paths.
Finding k shortest paths is possible by extending Dijkstra algorithm or Bellman-Ford algorithm.
