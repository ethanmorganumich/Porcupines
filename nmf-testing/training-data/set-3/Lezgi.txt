Lezgins or Leks (Lezgian: Лезгияр, Лекьер. IPA: lezgijar) are a Northeast Caucasian ethnic group native predominantly to southern Dagestan, a republic of Russia, and northeastern Azerbaijan. The Lezgin are predominantly Sunni Muslims and speak the Lezgi language.
The land of the Lezgins has been subject to multiple invaders throughout history. Its isolated terrain and the strategic value outsiders have placed on the areas settled by Lezgins has contributed much to the Lezgin community ethos and helped shape its national character. Due to constant attacks from the invaders, the Lezgins have developed a national code Lezgiwal. Lezgin society has traditionally been egalitarian and organized around many autonomous local clans, called syhils (сихилар).
Notable historical Lezgin leaders include Hadji-Dawud (1680 – 1735)  and Sheikh Muhammad (1771–1838).
