Autism spectrum

The autism spectrum, often referred to as just autism or in the context of a professional diagnosis autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or autism spectrum condition (ASC), is a range of neurodevelopmental conditions characterized by difficulties in social interaction, verbal and nonverbal communication, and the presence of repetitive behavior and restricted interests. Other common signs include struggling to form friendships and unusual responses to sensory stimuli.
Autism is generally defined as a spectrum disorder, which means that it can manifest differently in each person: any given autistic individual is likely to show some, but not all, of the characteristics associated with it, and the person may exhibit them to varying degrees. Some autistic people remain nonspeaking over the course of their lifespan, while others have relatively unimpaired spoken language. There is large variation in the level of support people require, and the same person may present differently at varying times. Historically, autism was divided into sub-categories, but there were persistent questions over the validity of these divisions, and the most recent editions of the diagnostic manuals, Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5, published in 2013) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD-11, released in 2021) both list ASD as a single disorder.
While psychiatry traditionally classifies autism as a neurodevelopmental disorder, many autistic people, most autistic advocates and a rapidly increasing number of researchers see autism as part of neurodiversity, the natural diversity in human thinking, and experience, with strengths, differences, and weaknesses. On this view, promoted by the autism rights movement, autism is not pathological, but this does not preclude autistic individuals from being disabled and potentially having high support needs due to co-occurring conditions and lack of person-environment fit. This relatively positive and holistic view of autism has led to a certain degree of friction between autistic individuals, advocates, charities, researchers and practitioners.Scientists are still trying to determine what causes autism; it is highly heritable and believed to be mainly genetic, but there are many genes involved, and environmental factors may also be relevant. Although there is no cure for autism, early behavioral interventions can help them gain self-care, social, and language skills. However, independent living is unlikely in severe autism, better referred to as autistic people with high support needs, so interventions for these individuals focus on, for example, finding and learning other modes of communication. It is unclear why autism frequently co-occurs with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, epilepsy, intellectual disability, amongst other conditions. There are ongoing disagreements about what should be included as part of the autism diagnosis, whether meaningful sub-types of autism exist, and the significance of autism-associated traits in the wider population. The combination of broader criteria and increased awareness has led to a trend of steadily increasing estimates of autism prevalence, causing a common misconception that there is an autism epidemic and perpetuating the controversial myth that it is caused by vaccines.
