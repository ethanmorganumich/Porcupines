The Entente Florale Europe ([ɑ̃.tɑ̃t flɔʁal ø.ʁɔp], "Flowery Alliance of Europe") is an international horticultural competition established to recognise municipalities and villages in Europe for excellence in horticultural displays. Trophies are presented annually by tourist boards and horticultural societies of European countries. There are three categories:

"Village" (population of less than 5,000).
