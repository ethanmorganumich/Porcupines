Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think is a 1996 book by cognitive linguist George Lakoff. It argues that conservatives and liberals hold two different conceptual models of morality. Conservatives have a strict father model in which people are made good through self-discipline and hard work, everyone is taken care of by taking care of themselves.   Liberals have a nurturant parent model in which everyone is taken care of by helping each other.
The first edition of the book was published with the subtitle What Conservatives Know That Liberals Don't.
