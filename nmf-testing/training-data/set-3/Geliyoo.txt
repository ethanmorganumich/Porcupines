Geliyoo is a Turkish company specializing in internet-related services and products. Founded on 18 November 2010 by Buray Anıl Savaş and Fatih Arslan, development had started a year earlier, in 2009. Geliyoo's services include a news aggregator and a search engine, which were released in 2013, and an in-development browser. The search engine had a major update in 2017, but as of 2022 is no longer available.
The company faced criticism in 2017, when it was revealed that it used a script sold on the internet to retrieve and show results from Google for its search engine, and when its website theme was also found to have been purchased from a third party. Geliyoo has also been accused of being a propaganda tool of the Turkish Government.
