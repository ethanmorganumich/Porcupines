Short circuit
||||||
A short circuit (sometimes abbreviated to short or s/c) is an electrical circuit that allows a current to travel along an unintended path with no or very low electrical impedance. This results in an excessive current flowing through the circuit.
The opposite of a short circuit is an "open circuit", which is an infinite resistance between two intersections
