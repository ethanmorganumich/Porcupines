Telamon
||||||
In Greek mythology, Telamon (; Ancient Greek: Τελαμών, Telamōn means "broad strap") was the son of King Aeacus of Aegina, and Endeïs, a mountain nymph. The elder brother of Peleus, Telamon sailed alongside Jason as one of his Argonauts, and was present at the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. In the Iliad, he was the father of Greek heroes Ajax the Great and Teucer by different mothers. Some accounts mention a third son of his, Trambelus. He and Peleus were also close friends of Heracles, assisting him on his expeditions against the Amazons and his assault on Troy (see below).
In an earlier account recorded by Pherecydes of Athens, Telamon and Peleus were not brothers, but friends. This would accord with Peleus being the father of the hero Achilles (Homer called him Pelides – i.e. son of Peleus). According to this account, Telamon was the son of Actaeus and Glauce, with the latter being the daughter of Cychreus, king of Salamis; and Telamon married Periboea (Eriboea), daughter of King Alcathous of Megara.
