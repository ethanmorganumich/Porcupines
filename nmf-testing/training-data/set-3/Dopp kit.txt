A toiletry bag (also called a toiletry kit, ditty bag, dopp kit, bathroom bag, sponge bag, toilet bag, toilet article kit, body hygiene kit, travel kit, washkit, shaving kit, or wet pack) is a portable container—usually a pouch with a drawstring or zippered closure—that holds body hygiene and toiletry supplies such as toothbrush and toothpaste, dental floss, cotton swabs, deodorant, nail clippers, tweezers, soap, shaving supplies, hair brush, tampons, contact lenses and supplies, and similar items while travelling and in other circumstances where permanent shelves and cupboards are unavailable or impractical for use.
