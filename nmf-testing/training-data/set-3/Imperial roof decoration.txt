Chinese imperial roof decorations or roof charms or roof-figures (Chinese: 檐獸/檐兽; pinyin: yán shòu) or "walking beasts" (Chinese: 走獸/走兽; pinyin: zǒu shòu) or "crouching beasts" (Chinese: 蹲獸/蹲兽; pinyin: Dūn shòu) were statuettes placed along the ridge line of official buildings of the Chinese empire. Only official buildings (palaces, government buildings, and some temples) were permitted to use such roof decorations.
