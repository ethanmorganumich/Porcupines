Tights
||||||
Tights are a kind of cloth garment, most often sheathing the body from the waist to the toe tips with a tight fit, hence the name. They come in absolute opaque, opaque, sheer and fishnet styles â€” or a combination, such as the original concept of the American term pantyhose with sheer legs and opaque panty.
