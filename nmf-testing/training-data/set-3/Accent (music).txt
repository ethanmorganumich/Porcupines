Accent (music)

In music, an accent is an emphasis, stress, or stronger attack placed on a particular note or set of notes, or chord, either as a result of its context or specifically indicated by an accent mark. Accents contribute to the articulation and prosody of a performance of a musical phrase. Accents may be written into a score or part by a composer or added by the performer as part of his or her interpretation of a musical piece.
Compared to surrounding notes:

A dynamic accent or stress accent is an emphasis using louder sound or a stronger sound, typically most pronounced on the attack of the sound.
A tonic accent is an emphasis on notes by virtue of being higher in pitch as opposed to higher in volume.
An agogic accent is an emphasis by virtue of being longer in duration.Accents which do not correspond to the stressed beats of the prevailing meter are said to be syncopated. For example, in common time, also called 4/4, the most common metre in popular music, the stressed beats are one and three. If accented chords or notes are played on beats two or four, this creates syncopation, as the music is emphasizing the "weak" beats of the bar. Syncopation is used in classical music, popular music and traditional music. However, it is more prominent in blues, jazz, funk, disco and Latin music.
