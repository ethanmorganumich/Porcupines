Puneri Pagadi
||||||
The Puneri Pagadi is a distinctive style of turban, which is considered as a symbol of pride and honor in the city of Pune. It was introduced two centuries ago. Though it is a symbol of honour, the use of the pagadi has changed over the years and now it is also used on traditional days in colleges. To preserve the identity of the pagadi, there were demands from the locals to grant it a Geographical Indication (GI) status. Their demand was fulfilled and the pagadi became an intellectual property on 4 September 2009.
