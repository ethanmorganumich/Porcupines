Bare trust
||||||
A bare trust is a trust in which the beneficiary has a right to both income and capital and may call for both to be remitted into his own name.  Assets in a bare trust are held in the name of a trustee, but the beneficiary has the right to all of the capital and income of the trust at any time if theyâ€™re 18 or over (in England and Wales), or 16 or over (in Scotland). Bare trusts are often used to pass assets to young people - the trustees look after them until the beneficiary is old enough.
