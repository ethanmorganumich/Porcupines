Abendmusik (German for "evening music", plural Abendmusiken) usually refers to a series of musical concert held in the St. Mary's Church, Lübeck (Marienkirche), Germany, begun in the 17th century and lasting until the early 19th century. Most of the music for these occasions, composed by Franz Tunder, Dieterich Buxtehude, and their successors, has been lost. Modern usage of term may also refer to any concerts in a church.
