Defensive towers of Cantabria
||||||
In Cantabria, there is a big number of fortified towers that fulfilled functions of housing and defense. These buildings, generally battlements, were erected mostly between the 13th and 15th centuries by noble families and influenced significantly in the architecture of Cantabria, passing some to be forts-houses, prelude to the future casona monta√±esa. A curious fact is that there are not in the region circular towers (except in some churches), as yes happens in the neighboring community of Asturias. Currently of the towers that survives several are in a deplorable condition.
The towers and castles that appear in medieval documents as castellum were very popular both as fortress as residences of nobles, mayors and gentlemen, and eventually generalized in the lower valleys of Cantabria, building on the hills and in the towns; one of the best examples of urban towers resulted in towns is the missing Torre de la Vega genesis of Torrelavega.The defensive towers of Cantabria, for its architectural features, can only be compared with those of Enkarterri comarca of Biscay surrounding.
