Tsunokakushi
||||||
The tsunokakushi (角隠し, lit. 'horn-hiding') is a type of traditional headdress worn by brides in Shinto wedding ceremonies in Japan.
The tsunokakushi is a rectangular piece of cloth, which covers the wig worn by the bride, traditionally-styled in the bunkin takashimada (文金高島田) style. The tsunokakushi is typically made of white silk, matching the bride's formal kimono outfit.
The tsunokakushi is said to be worn to veil the bride's "horns" of jealousy, ego and selfishness; it is also said to symbolise the bride's resolve to become a gentle and obedient wife.
