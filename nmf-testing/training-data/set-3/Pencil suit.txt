Pencil suit
||||||
A pencil suit is a variety of salwar kameez. The suit follows the principles of a pencil skirt and merges it with the traditional salwar kameez. 
While salwars are loosely fitted pants, pencil suits have tightly fitted pants that follow the contours of the lady's leg. It differs from the churidar only in the lack of the ruches or the “churis” near the ankle. The kameez is of thigh length and has a side seam left open below the waist-line. This attire is often marched with a dupatta of matching or contrasting color.
As with most designer suits, a pencil suit is also embellished with beads, mirror work, zardozi or zari work. Simple and plain variants of the suit are also available for daily wear.
