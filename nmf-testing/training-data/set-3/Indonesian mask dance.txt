Topeng (from Balinese: ᬢᭀᬧᬾᬂ, Sundanese: ᮒᮧᮕᮨᮔᮌ, and Javanese: ꦠꦺꦴꦥꦺꦁ, romanized: topeng, lit. 'mask') is a dramatic form of Indonesian dance in which one or more mask-wearing, ornately costumed performers interpret traditional narratives concerning fabled kings, heroes and myths, accompanied by gamelan or other traditional music instruments. Topeng dance is a typical Indonesian dance that can be found in various regions in Indonesia. Topeng dance has the main characteristic that the dancers use masks to cover their faces. The dance will usually be performed by one dancer or a group of dancers.
Topeng is widely used in dances that are part of traditional ceremonies or the retelling of ancient stories from the ancestors. It is believed that topeng is closely related to ancestral spirits which are considered interpretations of gods. In some tribes, topeng still adorns various daily artistic and customary activities. Topeng dance is a performance dance full of meaningful symbols that are expected to be understood by the audience. These symbols are conveyed through the colors of the masks, the expressions of the masks, and the accompanying music. The meaning conveyed can be in the form of leadership values, love, wisdom, and other meanings conveyed through the medium of dance movements.In 2010, topeng Cirebon from Cirebon, West Java was recognized as National Intangible Cultural Heritage of Indonesia by the Indonesian Ministry of Education and Culture.
