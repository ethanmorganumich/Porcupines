Bell pattern
||||||
A bell pattern is a rhythmic pattern of striking a hand-held bell or other instrument of the idiophone family, to make it emit a sound at desired intervals. It is often a key pattern (also known as a guide pattern, phrasing referent, timeline, or asymmetrical timeline),  in most cases it is a metal bell, such as an agog√¥, gankoqui, or cowbell, or a hollowed piece of wood, or wooden claves. In band music, bell patterns are also played on the metal shell of the timbales, and drum kit cymbals.
