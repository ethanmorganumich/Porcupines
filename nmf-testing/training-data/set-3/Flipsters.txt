Flipsters (flɪp-stərs) are folding shoes, designed in Australia by L&M Designs.  The footwear is produced in two styles: flip-flops and ballet flats.  Flipsters footwear fold into a pouch which can be fit into a handbag and act as an alternative to standard shoes. The product is designed to "fit into a small handbag to give stiletto-shoed feet a break" The flip-flops are made with a 3-part rubber sole and fabric heel guard that allows the shoe to collapse flat, and while expanded provides support and structure similar to a standard flip flop.  Flipsters come in a pouch designed to keep the product protected and clean.  The product was designed with a triangle fold designed to mimic the motion of natural walking. Matt Schmidt, Editor at "My Life News", described the innovative flipflop as "stylish and comfy".
