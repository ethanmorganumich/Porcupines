Cheongsam
||||||
Cheongsam (UK: , US: ), also known as the qipao () and sometimes referred to as the mandarin gown, is a Chinese dress worn by women which takes inspiration from the qizhuang, the ethnic clothing of the Manchu people. The cheongsam is most often seen as a longer, figure-fitting, one piece garment with a standing collar, an asymmetric, left-over-right (youren) opening and two side slits, and embellished with Chinese frog fasteners on the lapel and the collar. It was developed in the 1920s and evolved in shapes and design over years. It was popular in China from the 1920s to 1940s, overlapping the Republican era, and was popularized by Chinese socialites and high society women in Shanghai. It was also one of the national dress of the Republic of China in 1929: 48  and is currently the national dress of China, which symbolizes a generic Chinese national identity rather than a specific ethnic and/or ancestral identity.: 277  Although the cheongsam is sometimes perceived as being a traditional Chinese clothing, the cheongsam continues to evolve with times as it responds to the contemporary modern life.
