Competitiveness Policy Council
||||||
The Competitiveness Policy Council was an independent federal advisory committee chartered in 1988 to advise the president and the Congress on more effective policies to promote U.S. competitiveness.  The council had a unique quadrapartite membership composed of representatives from business, labor, government, and the public.
The council began operation in 1991, and ceased operation in 1997 after the Republican-led Congress failed to continue funding, and after council members decided to close out this successful experiment in the independent advisory function.
