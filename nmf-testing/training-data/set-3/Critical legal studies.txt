Critical legal studies
||||||
Critical legal studies (CLS) is a school of critical theory that developed in the United States during the 1970s. CLS adherents claim that laws are devised to maintain the status quo of society and thereby codify its biases against marginalized groups.Despite wide variation in the opinions of critical legal scholars around the world, there is general consensus regarding the key goals of Critical Legal Studies:

to demonstrate the ambiguity and possible preferential outcomes of supposedly impartial and rigid legal doctrines.
to publicize historical, social, economic and psychological results of legal decisions
to demystify legal analysis and legal culture in order to impose transparency on legal processes so that they earn the general support of socially responsible citizensThe abbreviations "CLS" and "Crit" are sometimes used to refer to the movement and its adherents.
