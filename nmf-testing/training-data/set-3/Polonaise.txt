The polonaise (, French: [pɔlɔnɛz]; Polish: polonez Polish pronunciation: [pɔˈlɔnɛs]) is a dance of Polish origin, in 34 time. Its name is French for "Polish".
The polonaise has a rhythm quite close to that of the Swedish semiquaver or sixteenth-note polska, and the two dances have a common origin.
The polonaise is a widespread dance in carnival parties. The polonaise is always a first dance at a studniówka ("student dance"), the Polish equivalent of the senior prom that occurs approximately 100 days before exams.
