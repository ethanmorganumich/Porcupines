Selburose
||||||
In Norwegian knitting, a selburose (Norwegian: [ˈsèːlbʉˌruːsə]) is a knitted rose pattern in the shape of a regular octagram. It is traditionally used for winter clothing such as the Selbu mitten (selbuvott) and sweaters (lusekofte, lopapeysa and mariusgenser). Of ancient origin, the pattern is associated with the town of Selbu in Norway, and has become an international symbol of Norway (or Scandinavia generally), Christmas and winter.
