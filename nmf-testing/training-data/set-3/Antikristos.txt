Antikristos or Antikrystós (Greek: αντικρυστός  χορός)  is a dance of Greek origin. “Aντικρυστός” in Greek language refers to the verb αντικρύζω “be across, opposite, face-to-face” (from Ancient Greek ἀντικρύ “vis-à-vis, face-to-face”). It is also known in Armenia. Antikristos has similarities with the karsilamas dance. It is danced in couples.
