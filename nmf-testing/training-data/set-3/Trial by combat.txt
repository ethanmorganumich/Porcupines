Trial by combat (also wager of battle, trial by battle or judicial duel) was a method of Germanic law to settle accusations in the absence of witnesses or a confession in which two parties in dispute fought in single combat; the winner of the fight was proclaimed to be right.  In essence, it was a judicially sanctioned duel.  It remained in use throughout the European Middle Ages, gradually disappearing in the course of the 16th century.
