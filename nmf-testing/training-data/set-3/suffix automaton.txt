Suffix automaton

In computer science, a suffix automaton is an efficient data structure for representing the substring index of a given string which allows the storage, processing, and retrieval of compressed information about all its substrings. The suffix automaton of a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is the smallest directed acyclic graph with a dedicated initial vertex and a set of "final" vertices, such that paths from the initial vertex to final vertices represent the suffixes of the string.
In terms of automata theory, a suffix automaton is the minimal partial deterministic finite automaton that recognizes the set of suffixes of a given string

        …
        
          s
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle S=s_{1}s_{2}\dots s_{n}}
  . The state graph of a suffix automaton is called a directed acyclic word graph (DAWG), a term that is also sometimes used for any deterministic acyclic finite state automaton.
Suffix automata were introduced in 1983 by a group of scientists from the University of Denver and the University of Colorado Boulder. They suggested a linear time online algorithm for its construction and showed that the suffix automaton of a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   having length at least two characters has at most

          |
        
        S
        
          |

    states and at most

        −

    {\textstyle 3|S|-4}
   transitions. Further works have shown a close connection between suffix automata and suffix trees, and have outlined several generalizations of suffix automata, such as compacted suffix automaton obtained by compression of nodes with a single outgoing arc.
Suffix automata provide efficient solutions to problems such as substring search and computation of the largest common substring of two and more strings.
