Behavior modification facility
||||||
A behavior modification facility (or youth residential program) is a residential educational and treatment institution enrolling adolescents who are perceived as displaying antisocial behavior, in an attempt to alter their conduct.
Due to irregular licensing rules across countries and states, as well as ambiguity regarding the labels that facilities use themselves, it is hard to gauge how widespread the facilities are. The facilities are part of what has been called the Troubled Teen Industry. Programs in the United States have been controversial due to widespread allegations of abuse and trauma imposed on the adolescents who are enrolled, as well as deceptive marketing practices aimed at parents. Critics say the facilities do not use evidence-based treatments.
