Heelys
||||||
Heelys (formerly known as Heeling Sports Limited) is an American brand of roller shoe (marketed by Heelys, Inc.) that have usually one or more removable wheels embedded in each sole, similar to inline skates, allowing the wearer to walk, run, or, by shifting their weight to their heels, roll. Braking can be achieved by lowering the back of the foot so that sole contacts the ground. Roger Adams patented Heelys in 1999. The headquarters are located in Carrollton, Texas.
