Moleskin
||||||
Moleskin is a heavy cotton fabric, woven and then shorn to create a short, soft pile on one side. The feel and appearance of its nap is suede-like, less plush than velour and more like felt or chamois. The word is also used for clothing made from this fabric. Clothing made from moleskin is noted for its softness and durability. Some variants of the cloth are so densely woven as to be windproof.Its name is due to the soft brushed hand of the fabric, similar to mole fur. Though mole pelts have been used to make fur clothing, they are not referred to as "moleskin", which is also a term for soft, dense adhesive pads stuck to the skin to prevent blisters.
