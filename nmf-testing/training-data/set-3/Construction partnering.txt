Construction partnering
||||||
Construction partnering is a type of business partnering used in the architecture, engineering and construction industry.  Partnering is intended to assist project teams with setting goals, resolving disputes and improving project outcomes.  The construction partnering team is made up of the projectâ€™s owner (client), the consulting engineers and/or architects, the contractor(s) and other key project stakeholders. Construction partnering has been used both in the United States and elsewhere since the early 1980s as a methodology to reduce litigation and improve productivity.
