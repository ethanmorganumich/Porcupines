Made-to-measure
||||||
Made-to-measure (MTM) typically refers to custom clothing that is cut and sewn using a standard-sized base pattern. Suits and sport coats are the most common garments made-to-measure. The fit of a made-to-measure garment is expected to be superior to that of a ready-to-wear garment because  made-to-measure garments are constructed to fit each customer individually based on a few body measurements to customize the pre-existing pattern. 
Made-to-measure garments always involve some form of standardization in the pattern and manufacturing, whereas bespoke tailoring is  entirely made from scratch based on a customer's specifications with far more attention to minute fit details and using multiple fittings during the construction process. 
All else being equal, a made-to-measure garment will be more expensive than a ready-to-wear garment but cheaper than a bespoke one. "Custom made" most often refers to MTM.
