Baladi

Baladi (Arabic: بلدي baladī; relative-adjective 'of town', 'local', 'rural', comparable to English folk, with a lower-class connotation) can refer to an Egyptian musical style, the folk style of Egyptian bellydance (Raqs Baladi), or the Masmoudi Sogheir rhythm, which is frequently used in baladi music. It is also sometimes spelled in English as 'beledi' or 'baladee'.
In Egypt, the term baladi does not only apply to local music and dance, and can also apply to many other things that are considered native, rural, rustic or traditional, for example 'baladi bread' or 'Aish Baladi". It is also applied to kinds of food and mostly to fruits and vegetables coming from rural villages.
