A hostile witness, also known as an adverse witness or an unfavorable witness, is a witness at trial whose  testimony on direct examination is either openly antagonistic or appears to be contrary to the legal position of the party who called the witness. This concept is used in the legal proceedings in the United States, and analogues of it exist in other legal systems in Western countries.
