4000-series integrated circuits
||||||
The 4000 series is a CMOS logic family of integrated circuits (ICs) first introduced in 1968 by RCA. It had a supply voltage range of 5V to 20V, which is much wider than any contemporary logic family.
Almost all IC manufacturers active during this initial era fabricated models for this series. Its naming convention is still in use today.
