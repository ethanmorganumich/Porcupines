The Cotswold style of architecture is a style based on houses from the Cotswold region of England, and is sometimes called the storybook style. Cotswold houses often have a prominent chimney, often near the front door of the house. Other notable features include king mullions and steep roofs.
The Cotswold style emerged during the late 16th century and flourished throughout the 17th century.: 6  During the second and third decades of the twentieth century, the Cotswold style reached its zenith of popularity.
Cotswold architecture is a subtype of the Tudor Revival house style, and it likely came to the United States as a result of renewed interest in medieval housing styles.
