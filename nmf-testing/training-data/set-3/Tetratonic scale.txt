Tetratonic scale
||||||
A tetratonic scale is a  musical scale or mode with four notes per octave. This is in contrast to a heptatonic (seven-note) scale such as the major scale and minor scale, or a dodecatonic (chromatic 12-note) scale, both common in modern Western music. Tetratonic scales are not common in modern art music, and are generally associated with prehistoric music.
