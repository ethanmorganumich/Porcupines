The Russian Revival style (historiographical names are: Russian style, Russian: русский стиль, Pseudo-Russian style, Russian: псевдорусский стиль, Neo-Russian style, Russian: нео-русский стиль, Russian Byzantine style, Russian: русско-византийский стиль) is a number of different movements within Russian architecture that arose in the second quarter of the 19th century and was an eclectic melding of Byzantine elements and pre-Petrine (Old Russian) architecture.
The Russian Revival architecture arose within the framework that the renewed interest in the national architecture, which evolved in Europe in the 19th century, and it is an interpretation and stylization of the Russian architectural heritage. Sometimes, Russian Revival architecture is often erroneously called Russian or Old-Russian architecture, but the majority of Revival architects did not directly reproduce the old architectural tradition. Being instead a skilful stylization, the Russian Revival style was consecutively combined with other international styles, from the architectural romanticism of first half of the 19th century to the modern style.
