Champagne breakfast
||||||
A champagne breakfast is a breakfast served with champagne or sparkling wine. It is a new concept in some countries and is not typical of the role of a breakfast.
It may be part of any day or outing considered particularly luxurious or indulgent. The accompanying breakfast is sometimes of a similarly high standard and may include rich foods such as salmon, caviar, chocolate or pastries, which would not ordinarily be eaten at breakfast, or may include additional courses. 
Instead of as a formal meal the breakfast can be given to the recipient in a basket or hamper.
