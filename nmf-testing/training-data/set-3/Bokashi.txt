Bokashi (horticulture)
||||||
Bokashi is a process that converts food waste and similar organic matter into a soil amendment which adds nutrients and improves soil texture. It differs from traditional composting methods in several respects. The most important are:

The input matter is fermented by specialist bacteria, not decomposed.
The fermented matter is fed directly to field or garden soil, without requiring further time to mature.
As a result, virtually all input carbon, energy and nutrients enter the soil food web, having been neither emitted in greenhouse gases and heat nor leached out.Other names attributed to this process include bokashi composting, bokashi fermentation and fermented composting.
