Corduroy
||||||
Corduroy is a textile with a distinctively raised "cord" or wale texture. Modern corduroy is most commonly composed of tufted cords, sometimes exhibiting a channel (bare to the base fabric) between them. Both velvet and corduroy derive from fustian fabric.
Corduroy looks as if it is made from multiple cords laid parallel to each other.
