A culminating project (also known as a senior project, grad project or exit project), is a project that challenges high school seniors to demonstrate their academic knowledge in an experiential way (in most cases). According to the United States Department of Education State Education Boards typically allow individual school districts to customize the project, based on basic state guidelines.
