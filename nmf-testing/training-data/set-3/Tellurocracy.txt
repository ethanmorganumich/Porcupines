Tellurocracy
||||||
Tellurocracy (from Latin: tellus, lit. 'land' and Greek: κράτος, romanized: krátos, lit. 'state') is a concept proposed by Aleksandr Dugin to describe a type of civilization or state system that is defined by the development of land territories and consistent penetration into inland territories. Tellurocratic states possess a set state-territory in which the state-forming ethnic majority lives, around this territory further land expansion occurs. Tellurocracy is conceived of as an antonym to thalassocracy. 
Most states display an amalgam of tellurocratic and thalassocratic features. In political geography, geopolitics and geo-economics, the term is used to explain the power of a country through its control over land. For example, prior to their merger, the Sultanate of Muscat was thalassocratic, but the Imamate of Oman was landlocked and purely tellurocratic. It could be suggested that most or all landlocked states are tellurocracies.
