Left–right political spectrum
||||||
The left–right political spectrum is a system of classifying political positions characteristic of left-right politics, ideologies and parties with emphasis placed upon issues of social equality and social hierarchy. In addition to positions on the left and on the right, there are centrists or moderates who are not strongly aligned with either end of the spectrum.
On this type of political spectrum, left-wing politics and right-wing politics are often presented as opposed, although a particular individual or group may take a left-wing stance on one matter and a right-wing stance on another; and some stances may overlap and be considered either left-wing or right-wing depending on the ideology. In France, where the terms originated, the left has been called "the party of movement" and the right "the party of order".Ambrose Bierce's  1911 Devil's Dictionary  characterized the right/left distinction, at the same time wryly noting each side's opinion of the other, by defining a conservative as "A statesman who is enamored of existing evils, as distinguished from the Liberal, who wishes to replace them with others."
