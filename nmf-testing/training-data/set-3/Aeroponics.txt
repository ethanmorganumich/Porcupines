Aeroponics
||||||
Aeroponics is the process of growing plants in an air or mist environment without the use of soil or an aggregate medium. The word "aeroponic" is derived from the Greek meanings of aer ("air") and ponos ("labour"). It is a type of hydroponics, since water is used in aeroponics to transmit nutrients.
