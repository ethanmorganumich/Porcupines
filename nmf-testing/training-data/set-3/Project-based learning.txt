Project-based learning
||||||
Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.  Students learn about a subject by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to a complex question, challenge, or problem.  It is a style of active learning and inquiry-based learning.  PBL contrasts with paper-based, rote memorization, or teacher-led instruction that presents established facts or portrays a smooth path to knowledge by instead posing questions, problems or scenarios.
