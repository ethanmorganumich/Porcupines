Quicksort is an efficient, general-purpose sorting algorithm. Quicksort was developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. Overall, it is slightly faster than merge sort and heapsort for randomized data, particularly on larger distributions.Quicksort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. For this reason, it is sometimes called partition-exchange sort. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
Quicksort is a comparison sort, meaning that it can sort items of any type for which a "less-than" relation (formally, a total order) is defined. Most implementations of quicksort are not stable, meaning that the relative order of equal sort items is not preserved.
Mathematical analysis of quicksort shows that, on average, the algorithm takes 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        n
        log

          n
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n\log {n})}
   comparisons to sort n items. In the worst case, it makes 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          n
          
            2
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n^{2})}
   comparisons.
