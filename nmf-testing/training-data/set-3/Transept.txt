Transept
||||||
A transept (with two semitransepts) is a transverse part of any building, which lies across the main body of the edifice. In cruciform churches, a transept is an area set crosswise to the nave in a cruciform ("cross-shaped") building within the Romanesque and Gothic Christian church architectural traditions. Each half of a transept is known as a semitransept.
