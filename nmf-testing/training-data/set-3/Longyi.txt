Longyi

A longyi (Burmese: လုံချည်; MLCTS: lum hkyany; pronounced [lòʊɰ̃dʑì]) is a sheet of cloth widely worn in Burma (Myanmar). It is approximately 2 metres (6.6 ft) long and 80 centimetres (2.6 ft) wide. The cloth is often sewn into a cylindrical shape. It is worn around the waist, running to the feet, and held in place by folding fabric over without a knot. It is sometimes folded up to the knee for comfort. Myanmar longyi originated in India. Similar garments are found in India, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Malay Archipelago. In the Indian subcontinent it is known variously as a lungi, longi, kaili or saaram.
