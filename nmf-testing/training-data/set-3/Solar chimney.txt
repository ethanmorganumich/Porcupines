This article refers to a device for ventilation. For the power generation technology, see Solar updraft tower.A solar chimney –  often referred to as a thermal chimney –  is a way of improving the natural ventilation of buildings by using convection of air heated by passive solar energy. A simple description of a solar chimney is that of a vertical shaft utilizing solar energy to enhance the natural stack ventilation through a building.
The solar chimney has been in use for centuries, particularly in the Middle East and Near East by the Persians, as well as in Europe by the Romans.
