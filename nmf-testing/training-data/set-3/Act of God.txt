Act of God
||||||
In legal usage in the English-speaking world, an act of God is a natural hazard outside human control, such as an earthquake or tsunami, for which no person can be held responsible. An act of God may amount to an exception to liability in contracts (as under the Hagueâ€“Visby Rules) or it may be an "insured peril" in an insurance policy. In Scots law the equivalent term is damnum fatale.By contrast, other extraordinary man-made or political events are deemed force majeure.
