Flower bouquet
||||||
A flower bouquet is a collection of flowers in a creative arrangement.  Flower bouquets can be arranged for the decor of homes or public buildings, or may be handheld.  Handheld bouquets are classified by several different popular shapes and styles, including nosegay, crescent, and cascading bouquets. Flower bouquets are often given for special occasions such as birthdays, anniversaries or funerals. They are also used extensively in weddings as well as Olympics Medal Ceremonies. Bouquets arranged in vases or planters for home decor can be arranged in either traditional or modern styles. Symbolism may be attached to the types of flowers used, according to the culture.
