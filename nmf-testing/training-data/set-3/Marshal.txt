Marshal
||||||
Marshal is a term used in several official titles in various branches of society. As marshals became trusted members of the courts of Medieval Europe, the title grew in reputation. During the last few centuries, it has been used for elevated offices, such as in military rank and civilian law enforcement.
In most countries, the rank of Marshal is the highest Army rank (equivalent to a five-star General of the Army in the United States).
