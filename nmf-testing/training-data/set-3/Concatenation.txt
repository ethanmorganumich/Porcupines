Concatenation
||||||
In formal language theory and computer programming, string concatenation  is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end.  For example, the concatenation of "snow" and "ball" is "snowball". In certain formalisations of concatenation theory, also called string theory, string concatenation is a primitive notion.
