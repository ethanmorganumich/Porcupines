Kath kuni architecture

Kath-Kuni is an indigenous construction technique prevalent in the isolated hills of northern India, especially in the region of Himachal Pradesh. In Uttarakhand, a similar architectural style is known as Koti Banal (named after the village where during the 1991 Uttarkashi earthquake, the buildings made with traditional architecture largely remained unharmed). It is a traditional technique that uses alternating layers of long thick wooden logs and stone masonry, held in place usually without using mortar. It has been transmitted orally and empirically from one generation to the next, through apprenticeships spanning a number of years.  The technique was devised keeping the seismic activity, topography, environment, climate, native materials and cultural landscape in perspective. Most of the oldest temples, in the region, are built using this ancient system. This unique construction technique has led to the formation of a vernacular architectural prototype known as Kath-Kuni (cator and cribbage) architecture.
