Melharmony
||||||
Melharmony is an avant-garde form of music composing that explores new harmonies and voice leading anchored on melodic progression. In other words, melharmony aims to create chords and counterpoints based on the melodic rules of evolved systems across the world. Melharmony thus blends the two primary, yet diverse concepts in world music - melody and harmony.  It was originally proposed and developed by musician-composer N. Ravikiran. British-American composer Robert Morris  further developed it from the standpoint of Western theory. Melharmony is a style of music that takes into consideration the rules and aesthetics of melody-centric systems like Indian classical as well as harmony-anchored systems like Western classical and jazz but is not limited to only those.
