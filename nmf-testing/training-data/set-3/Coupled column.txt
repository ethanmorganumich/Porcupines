Coupled column
||||||
A coupled column (also accouplement, twinned or paired column) is one of a pair of columns that are installed nearer together and wider with others. The coupled columns should be of the same order and set closer enough to almost touch each other at their bases and capitals. These columns were mostly used in the architecture of the 17th century and later. In a colonnade, all columns may be coupled or just the outer pairs. Ð¡oupled columns are often installed at the building entrance, on both sides of a window, fireplace, niche, or stair. Pilasters and engaged columns can also be paired.
