MVDDS dispute
||||||
The MVDDS dispute refers to several legal disputes and political controversies that surrounded Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approval of MVDDS terrestrial wireless broadband technology.  The controversy arose over the lobbying efforts of Northpoint Technology, a developer of MVDDS, to receive approval and licensing for the technology.  The dispute later transformed into several court cases against the FCC and satellite television providers, as well as a patent infringement case against MDS America and MDS International.  As a result of the dispute, Northpoint lost the patents.
