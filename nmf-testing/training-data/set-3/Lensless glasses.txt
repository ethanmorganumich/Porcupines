Lensless glasses
||||||
Lensless glasses are glasses that lack lenses. They are worn solely for aesthetic or fashion purposes, having no function in vision correction or eye protection. The frames are usually oversized, and commonly all black in color. They may be worn in conjunction with contact lenses. Advantages of lensless glasses are that they do not fog or reflect, and there is no lens that will touch long eyelashes and eyelash extensions.Lensless glasses first became popular in Japan in the 1990s. The trend died out, but has resurged recently in China and Taiwan.Maison Martin Margiela released gold frames that are lensless and half-rimless.
