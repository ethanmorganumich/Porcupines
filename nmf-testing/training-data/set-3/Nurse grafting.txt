Nurse grafting
||||||
Nurse grafting is a method of plant propagation that is used for hard-to-root plant material. If a desirable selection cannot be grown from seed (because a seed-grown plant will be genetically different from the parent), it must be propagated asexually (cloned) in order to be genetically identical to the parent. Nurse grafting allows a scion to develop its own roots, instead of being grafted to a rootstock.
