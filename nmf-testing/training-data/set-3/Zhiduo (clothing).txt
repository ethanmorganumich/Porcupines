||||||
Zhiduo (viz. Chinese: 直掇; pinyin: zhíduō; lit. 'straight gathering': 直裰 and 直綴 and 直敠), also known as zhishen (Chinese: 直身; pinyin: zhíshēn; lit. 'straight body'; Korean: 직신; Hanja: 直身; RR: Jikshin) when it is decorated with outside pendulums, and haiqing (Chinese: 海青; lit. 'ocean blue'), refers to two types of traditional changyi (simplified Chinese: 长衣; traditional Chinese: 長衣; lit. 'long clothing') or (shenyi-structured) paofu which were worn as outer robes by men in the broad sense; i.e. the casual zhiduo in Hanfu and the priests’ zhiduo, in the broad sense. As a specific term, the zhiduo refers to the former. The zhiduo was also called daopao by Wang Zhishen in the Ming dynasty although the daopao refers to another kind of paofu. Nowadays, the haiqing is sometimes referred as daopao. In present days Taiwan, the haiqing is also worn by the Zhenyi Taoist priests. The term "haiqing" can also be a specific term which refers to the long black or yellow robe worn by Buddhist monks.The zhiduo was also introduced in both Japan and Korea where Chinese Buddhism had been spread. In Japan, the zhiduo was pronounced jikitotsu (Japanese: 直綴/じきとつ). In Korea, the zhiduo was pronounced as jikcheol (Korean: 직철; Hanja: 直裰), and was also referred as the jangsam (Korean: 장삼; Hanja: 長衫) of the Buddhist monks; the jikcheol was worn under the Kasaya until the early Joseon period.
