Aging offender
||||||
An aging offender or an elderly offender is an individual over the age of 55 who breaks the law or is in prison. The numbers of elderly individuals breaking the law and being placed in prison is increasing, and presents a number of problems for correctional facilities in terms of health care and provision, as well as mental, social and physical health and healthcare issues for the inmates themselves. Incarceration also tends to accelerate the aging process.
