The Stylophone is a miniature analog electronic keyboard musical instrument played with a stylus. Invented in 1967 by Brian Jarvis, it entered production in 1968, manufactured by Dubreq.
Some three million Stylophones were sold, mostly as children's toys, but were occasionally used by professional musicians such as Rolf Harris, John Lennon, Kraftwerk and David Bowie.
