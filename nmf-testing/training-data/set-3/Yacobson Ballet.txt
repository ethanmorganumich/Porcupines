Yacobson Ballet is a Russian ballet company. It was founded in 1969 by Ballet Master and choreographer Leonid Yacobson. It was the first Russian independent company which gained prominence within the Russian ballet landscape and received the title of "Miniature Company", referring to the short lengths of the pieces created by its founder. During seven years as a director, Yacobson worked on the development of dance in Russia and collaborated with dancers including Natalia Makarova, Alla Osipenko, Maya Plisetskaya and Mikhail Baryshnikov.After Yacobson's death in 1976, his closest collaborator opened the repertoire to Russian and foreign choreographers, developing a repertoire of creations based on the founding technique of ballet. The company also began to work outside of Russia.
