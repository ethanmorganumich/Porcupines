The traditional Thai house (Thai: เรือนไทย, RTGS: ruean thai, pronounced [rɯ̄a̯n tʰāj]; lit. 'Thai house') is a loose collection of vernacular architectural styles employed throughout the different regions of Thailand. Thai houses usually feature a bamboo or wooden structure, raised on stilts and topped with a steep gabled roof. The houses from each of Thailand's regions have distinctive styles, which reflect the people's living style, including social and cultural beliefs or religious customs and occupations.
