Ammunition boot
||||||
Ammunition boots are a form of military footwear. They were the standard combat boot for the British Army and other forces around the British Empire and Commonwealth from at least the mid-1860s until their replacement a century later in the 1960s with the rubber-soled Boots DMS (for 'Direct Moulded Sole').They replaced the earlier ankle boots that had been in service since the early 1800s. Ammunition boots (now known as Boots, Ankle, General Service) remain in use today by British and Commonwealth armies for ceremonial public duties, most notably by the British Army's Household Division, who provide the King's Guard.
The term "Ammunition boots" is a generic term for these heavy, studded ankle boots, which were produced in a variety of patterns. The name supposedly comes from the boots' being historically procured by the Master Gunner and the Munitions Board at Woolwich (the Regiment of Artillery's headquarters) rather than Horse Guards (the headquarters of the British Army), and being of 'ammunition quality'.
