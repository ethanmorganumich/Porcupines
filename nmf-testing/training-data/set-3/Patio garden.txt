A patio (, from Spanish: patio [Ëˆpatjo]; "courtyard", "forecourt", "yard", "little garden") is an outdoor space generally used for dining or recreation that adjoins a structure and is typically paved. In Australia the term is expanded to include roofed structures such as a veranda, which provides protection from sun and rain.
