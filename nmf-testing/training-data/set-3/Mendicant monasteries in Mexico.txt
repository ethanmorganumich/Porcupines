Mendicant monasteries in Mexico
||||||
Mendicant monasteries in Mexico were one of the architectural solutions devised by the friars of the Mendicant orders in the 16th century to the evangelization in the New Spain. The religious function of these buildings was thought for an enormous number of Amerindian indigenous people to evangelize although soon, due to the policy of reduction, the whole became the social center of the pueblos de indios, transmitting to them the civil modes of the West, Castilian, various arts and crafts, health, and even funeral services. 
The buildings were based on architectural styles that were already in disuse for the time, such as Romanesque and Gothic, and on the European monastic model – essentially on the Cluny Abbey – but they added innovative elements such as the atrial cross and the capilla abierta, as well as being characterized by various decorative currents and a strong appearance as fortresses. Within these buildings, distributed in the center of modern Mexico, is found an art originated both in stone carving and in pictorial decoration: the tequitqui or Indochristian art, a kind of style made by the indigenous people who made art in the buildings based on European patterns and directed by the friars.
