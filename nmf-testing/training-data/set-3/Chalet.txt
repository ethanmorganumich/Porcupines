A chalet (pronounced  SHAL-ay in British English; in American English usually  shal-AY), also called Swiss chalet, is a type of building or house, typical of the Alpine region in Europe. It is made of wood, with a heavy, gently sloping roof and wide, well-supported eaves set at right angles to the front of the house.
