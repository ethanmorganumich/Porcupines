Buzz cut
||||||
A buzz cut, or wiffle cut, is a term that is used to refer to any of a variety of short hairstyles, especially where the length of hair is the same on all parts of the head. Rising to prominence initially with the advent of manual hair clippers, buzz cuts became increasingly popular in places where strict grooming conventions applied. In several nations, buzz cuts are often given to new recruits in the armed forces. However, buzz cuts are also used for stylistic reasons.
