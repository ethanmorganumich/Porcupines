Setchūyō
||||||
Setchūyō (折衷様, lit. eclectic style) is an architectural style born in Japan during the Muromachi period from the fusion of elements from three different antecedent styles: wayō,  daibutsuyō, and zenshūyō. It is exemplified by the main hall at Kakurin-ji.  The combination of wayō and daibutsuyō in particular became so frequent that sometimes it is classed separately by scholars under the name Shin-wayō (新和様, new wayō).
