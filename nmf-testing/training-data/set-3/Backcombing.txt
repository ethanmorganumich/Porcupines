Backcombing
||||||
Backcombing (also known as teasing or ratting) is a way of combing hair which is used to create volume as well as to create certain hairstyles.  Backcombing is done by repeatedly combing the hair towards the scalp, causing the hair to tangle and knot up. This method is often used in creating various big hair styles such as beehives, bouffants and dreadlocks.
