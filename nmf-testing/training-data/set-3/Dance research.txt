Dance research is the study of dance, including dance history, ethnochoreology, dance theory, dance anthropology, and dance science.
Dance research as an academic discipline is relatively new. In 1967, the first volume of the CORD dance research annual wrote: "...One of the most serious problems in dance research is found in the fact that the literati in the field are not yet the university people".Dance science is the scientific study of dance and dancers, as well as the practical application of scientific principles to dance, similar to sports science. Its aims are the enhancement of performance, the reduction of injury, and the improvement of well-being and health.
