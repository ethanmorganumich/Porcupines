Mineral rights
||||||
Mineral rights are property rights to exploit an area for the minerals it harbors. Mineral rights can be separate from property ownership (see Split estate).  Mineral rights can refer to sedentary minerals that do not move below the Earth's surface or fluid minerals such as oil or natural gas.  There are three major types of mineral property; unified estate, severed or split estate, and fractional ownership of minerals.
