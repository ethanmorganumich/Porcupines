Mock election
||||||
A mock election is an election for educational demonstration, amusement, or political protest reasons to call for free and fair elections.  Less precisely it can refer to a real election purely for advisory (essentially without power) committees or forums such as some student councils, particularly those that chiefly emulate a real legislative body.
