Português Suave architecture
||||||
Português Suave was an architectural style promoted by the Portuguese Estado Novo regime, essentially during the 1940s and the early 1950s. Officially promoted by the Portuguese government at the time as Estilo Português ("Portuguese Style"), it became more popularly known as "Português Suave" after a brand of cigarettes of the same name. This architectural style is also known Estado Novo style, but this last denomination is not very correct, since during the Portuguese New State Regimen diverse architectural styles have been applied in public buildings.
