'Long robe'), and dagua (Chinese: 大褂; pinyin: Dàguà; lit. 'Great jacket'), is a form of paofu , Chinese robe, which was derived from the Qing dynasty qizhuang, the traditional dress of the Manchu people, which were worn by Manchu men.: 129  The changshan was actually developed by the Han Chinese through the modification of their own Ming dynasty's Hanfu by adopting some Manchu men's clothing elements in one of their Hanfu changshan.: 129  In function, the changshan is considered the male equivalent of the women's cheongsam (also known as qipao). The changshan was often worn by men with a magua, also commonly translated as "riding jacket" in English language.
