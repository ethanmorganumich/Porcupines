Gloriette
||||||
A gloriette (from the 12th-century French gloire meaning "little room") is a building in a garden erected on a site that is elevated with respect to the surroundings.  The structural execution and shape can vary greatly, often in the form of a pavilion or tempietto, more or less open on the sides.
