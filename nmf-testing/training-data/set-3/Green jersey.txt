Green jersey
||||||
In road bicycle racing (e.g. Grand Tour stage races) the green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the most consistent highest finisher in the competition.While the overall race leader in the Tour de France will wear the yellow jersey, or "maillot jaune", the green jersey ("maillot vert") will be worn by the leader in the points competition. Since 2009, the Vuelta a Espa√±a has also used the green jersey to signify the leader of the points competition. In the Giro d'Italia, the green jersey was, from 1974 to 2011, worn by the King of the Mountains, the leader in the competition for climbing specialists.
