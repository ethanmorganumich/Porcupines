Sanbenito
||||||
Sanbenito (Spanish: sambenito; Catalan: gramalleta, sambenet) was a penitential garment that was used especially during the Spanish Inquisition. It was similar to a scapular, either yellow with red saltires for penitent heretics, or black and decorated with devils and flames for impenitent heretics to wear at an auto-da-f√© (meaning "act of faith").
