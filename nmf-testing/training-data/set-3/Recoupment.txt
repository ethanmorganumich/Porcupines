Recoupment
||||||
Recoupment, in the music industry, is when a record label pays for a musical artist's expenses, such as for recording and marketing, and later deducts an equal amount from the artist's royalties, which are between 15 and 20 percent of sales revenue. The practice is common, and most new artists have little choice but to accept it since they lack the negotiating power to obtain a better contract.
