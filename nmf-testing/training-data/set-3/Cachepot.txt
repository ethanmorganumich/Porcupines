A cachepot (, French: [kaʃpo]) is a French term for what is usually called in modern English a "planter" or for older examples a jardiniere, namely a decorative container or "overpot" for a plant and its flowerpot, for indoors use, usually with no drainage hole at the bottom, or sometimes with a matching saucer.  It is intended to be more attractive than the terracotta (or today, plastic) flowerpot in which the plant grows, and to keep water off furniture surfaces.Another French term is jardinière; the distinction is that that is usually larger, and may sit on the floor, either indoors or outdoors.  They are often rectangular, where a cachepot is typically round.  A cachepot is meant to be displayed on a tabletop, mantel, or shelf indoors.In modern English the term is usually found in descriptions of pottery examples.
