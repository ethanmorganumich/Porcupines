Caller (dancing)
||||||
A caller is a person who prompts dance figures in such dances as line dance, square dance, and contra dance.  The caller might be one of the participating dancers, though in modern country dance this is rare.
In round dance a person who performs this function is called a cuer.  Their role is fundamentally the same as a caller, in that they tell dancers what to do in a given dance, though they differ on several smaller points. In northern New England contra dancing, the caller is also known as the prompter.
