Substring
||||||
In formal language theory and computer science, a substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For instance, "the best of" is a substring of "It was the best of times". In contrast, "Itwastimes" is a subsequence of "It was the best of times", but not a substring.
Prefixes and suffixes are special cases of substrings. A prefix of a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a substring of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   that occurs at the beginning of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  ; likewise, a suffix of a string 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   is a substring that occurs at the end of 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
  .
The substrings of the string "apple" would be:
"a", "ap", "app", "appl", "apple",
"p", "pp", "ppl", "pple",
"pl", "ple",
"l", "le"
"e", "" 
(note the empty string at the end).
