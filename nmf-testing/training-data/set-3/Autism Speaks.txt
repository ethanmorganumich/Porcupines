Autism Speaks
||||||
Autism Speaks Inc. is an autism advocacy organization and the largest autism research organization in the United States. It sponsors autism research and conducts awareness and outreach activities aimed at families, governments, and the public. It was founded in February 2005 by Bob Wright and his wife Suzanne, a year after their grandson Christian was diagnosed with autism. The same year as its founding, the organization merged with Autism Coalition for Research and Education. It then merged with the National Alliance for Autism Research in 2006 and Cure Autism Now in 2007.
The autism rights movement and neurodiversity advocates see autism as a difference rather than a disease that needs to be cured, and have criticized Autism Speaks for seeking a cure. However, the word "cure" was dropped from its mission statement in 2016.
