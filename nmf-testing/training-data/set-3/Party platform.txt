Party platform
||||||
A political party platform (US English), party program, or party manifesto (preferential term in British & often Commonwealth English) is a formal set of principle goals which are supported by a political party or individual candidate, in order to appeal to the general public, for the ultimate purpose of garnering the general public's support and votes about complicated topics or issues. A component of a political platform is often called a plank â€“ the opinions and viewpoints about an individual topic, as held by a party, person, or organization.  The word plank depicts a component of an overall political platform, as a metaphorical reference to a basic stage made of boards or planks of wood.  The metaphor can return to its literal origin when public speaking or debates are actually held upon a physical platform.
In the United Kingdom and certain other countries, the party platform is referred to as the party's "manifesto" or political programme. Across the Western world, political parties are highly likely to fulfill their election promises.
