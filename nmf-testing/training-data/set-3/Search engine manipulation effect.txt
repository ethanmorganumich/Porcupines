Search engine manipulation effect
||||||
The search engine manipulation effect (SEME) is a term invented by Robert Epstein in 2015 to describe a hypothesized change in consumer preferences and voting preferences by search engines.  Rather than search engine optimization where advocates, websites, and businesses seek to optimize their placement in the search engine's algorithm, SEME focuses on the search engine companies themselves.  According to the psychologist Epstein, search engine companies both could massively manipulate consumer and vote sentiment, and furthermore would do so to ensure their favored candidates win. Epstein propounded that such manipulations could shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more, and up to 80 percent in some demographics, and would change the outcomes in over 25% of national elections.In response to the allegations, Google denied re-ranking search results to manipulate user sentiment, or tweaking ranking specially for elections or political candidates.
