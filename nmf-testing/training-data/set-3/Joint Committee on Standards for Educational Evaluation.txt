Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation
||||||
The Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation [1] is an American/Canadian based Standards Developer Organization (SDO). The Joint Committee, created in 1975, represents a coalition of major professional associations formed in 1975 to develop evaluation standards and improve the quality of standardized evaluation. The Committee has thus far published three sets of standards for evaluations. The Personnel Evaluation Standards (2nd edition) [2] was published in 1988 and updated in 2008, The Program Evaluation Standards (2nd edition) [3] was published in 1994 (the third edition of which is in draft form as of 2008), and The Student Evaluation Standards [4] was published in 2003.
The Joint Committee is a private nonprofit organization. It is accredited by the American National Standards Institute [5] (ANSI). Standards approved by ANSI become American National Standards [6].  In addition to setting standards in evaluation, it also is involved in reviewing and updating its published standards (every five years); training policymakers, evaluators, and educators in the use of the standards; and serving as a clearinghouse on evaluation standards literature.
The Committee performs its work on behalf of its constituents, namely, the people and groups involved in conducting educational evaluations and using the results of educational evaluations. The Joint Committee has three sets of standards published at this time: The Student Evaluation Standards, The Personnel Evaluation Standards and The Program Evaluation Standards.
Each publication presents and elaborates a set of standards for use in a variety of educational settings. The standards provide guidelines for designing, implementing, assessing and improving the identified form of evaluation. Each of the standards has been placed in one of four fundamental categories to promote educational evaluations that are proper, useful, feasible, and accurate.
