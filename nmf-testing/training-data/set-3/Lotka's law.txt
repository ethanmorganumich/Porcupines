Lotka's law
||||||
Lotka's law, named after Alfred J. Lotka, is one of a variety of special applications of Zipf's law.  It describes the frequency of publication by authors in any given field. It states that the number of authors making  
  
    
      
        x
      
    
    {\displaystyle x}
    contributions in a given period is a fraction of the number making a single contribution, following the formula  
  
    
      
        1
        
          /
        
        
          x
          
            a
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 1/x^{a}}
    where 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
   nearly always equals two, i.e., an approximate inverse-square law, where the number of authors publishing a certain number of articles is a fixed ratio to the number of authors publishing a single article.  As the number of articles published increases, authors producing that many publications become less frequent.  There are 1/4 as many authors publishing two articles within a specified time period as there are single-publication authors, 1/9 as many publishing three articles, 1/16 as many publishing four articles, etc.  Though the law itself covers many disciplines, the actual ratios involved (as a function of 'a') are discipline-specific.

The general formula says:

  
    
      
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        Y
        =
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle X^{n}Y=C}
  or

  
    
      
        Y
        =
        C
        
          /
        
        
          X
          
            n
          
        
        ,
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y=C/X^{n},\,}
  where X is the number of publications, Y the relative frequency of authors with X publications, and n and 
  
    
      
        C
      
    
    {\displaystyle C}
   are constants depending on the specific field (
  
    
      
        n
        â‰ˆ
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\approx 2}
  ).
