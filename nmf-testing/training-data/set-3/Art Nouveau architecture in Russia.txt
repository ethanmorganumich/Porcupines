Art Nouveau architecture in Russia

Art Nouveau is an international style of art, architecture and applied arts, especially the decorative arts, that was most popular between 1893 and 1910. In the Russian language it is called Art Nouveau or Modern (in Cyrillic: Ар-нувo, Моде́рн). 

Art Nouveau architecture in Russia was mostly built in large cities by merchants and Old Believers, and was highly influenced by the contemporary movements that constituted the Art Nouveau style: the Glasgow School, Jugendstil of Germany, Vienna Secession, as well as Russian Revival architecture and the National Romantic style of Nordic countries (one of which, Grand Duchy of Finland, was a part of Russian Empire)  In some Russian towns, there also were earlier examples of wooden architecture, the architecture of Kievan Rus', which influenced the style.
Some Russian Art Nouveau buildings were built on territories that were part of Germany and the Grand Duchy of Finland during the Art Nouveau period and were ceded to the Soviet Union after World War II. Russian architects also worked on the development of Harbin in China after 1898, which explains the presence of Art Nouveau architecture there.
