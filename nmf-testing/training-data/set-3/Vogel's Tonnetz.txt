Vogel's Tonnetz
||||||
Vogel's Tonnetz is a graphical and mathematical representation of the scale range of just intonation, introduced by German music theorist Martin Vogel 1976 in his book Die Lehre von den Tonbeziehungen (English: On the Relations of Tone, 1993). 
The graphical representation is based on Euler's Tonnetz, adding a third dimension for just sevenths to the two dimensions for just fifths and just thirds. 
It serves to illustrate and analyze chords and their relations.
The four-dimensional mathematical representation including octaves allows the Evaluation of the congruency of harmonics of chords depending on the tonal material. 
It can thus also serve to determine the optimal tonal material for a certain chord.
