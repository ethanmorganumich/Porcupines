Slap bracelet
||||||
A slap bracelet (or snap bracelet) was a bracelet invented by Wisconsin teacher Stuart Anders in 1983, sold originally under the brand name of "Slap Wrap". Consisting of layered, flexible stainless steel bistable spring bands sealed within a fabric, silicone, or plastic cover, it can snap around a wrist when slapped on it with some force. It can have many different colours and/or designs.
