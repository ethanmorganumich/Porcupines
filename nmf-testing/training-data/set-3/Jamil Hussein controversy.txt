Jamil Hussein controversy
||||||
The Jamil Hussein controversy was an instance where conservative blogger Michelle Malkin questioned an Associated Press source.
In an Associated Press (AP) article dated November 25, 2006, it was reported that "rampaging militiamen burned and blew up four mosques" in the Hurriya neighborhood of Baghdad and that six Sunnis had been dragged out of prayers and burned alive. The AP report was attributed to "Jamil Hussein", identified as a captain in the Iraqi police. In the words of The Washington Post, the attacks "... illustrated Iraqi security forces' inability to rein in violence, at a time when U.S. leaders want them to take greater responsibility for the country's security, a vital benchmark for any strategy to withdraw U.S. troops."Following up on the report, the Multinational Force Iraq claimed that an Iraqi Army patrol investigating the area found only one mosque had been burned and that the patrol had been unable to confirm media reports that six Sunni civilians had been burned to death."When Jamil Hussein was called upon to substantiate his claims, the Interior Ministry initially denied that he was a member of the Multinational Force Iraq.  Attempts to locate and identify Hussein failed, and it was later suggested by conservative bloggers, including Michelle Malkin, that he did not exist. In January 2007, the Interior Ministry recognized Hussein as an active member of the Multinational Force Iraq.
Malkin has issued a correction for her denial of Hussein's existence but contests AP claims of destroyed mosques and civilians burned alive. Malkin visited Iraq and verified that only one mosque had suffered significant damage. She further stated that the AP's only corroborating witness had recanted and that no one since has found any evidence of the claim about people being burned alive.
