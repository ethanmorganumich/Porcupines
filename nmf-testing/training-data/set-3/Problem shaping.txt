Problem shaping means revising a question so that the solution process can begin or continue.  
It is part of the larger problem process that includes problem finding and problem solving. Problem shaping (or problem framing) often involves the application of critical thinking.
Algorithmic approach to technical problems reformulation was introduced by G. S. Altshuller in ARIZ.
