RIBA Competitions is the Royal Institute of British Architects' unit dedicated to organising architectural and other design-related competitions.Architectural design competitions are used by an organisation that plans to build a new building or refurbish an existing building.  They can be used for buildings, engineering work, structures, landscape design projects or public realm artworks.  A competition typically asks for architects and/or designers to submit a design proposal in response to a given brief.  The winning design will then be selected by an independent jury panel of design professionals and client representatives.  The independence of the jury is vital to the fair conduct of a competition.
The objective of a competition is to explore a range of different design options to select the best response to the design brief, which would not be possible by pre-selecting one architect.
The competitions process is often used to generate new ideas, create blue-sky thinking, stimulate debate, raise the profile of the project and allow an opportunity for emerging talent to grow as well as established design practices.
