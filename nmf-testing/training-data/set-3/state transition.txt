State-transition table
||||||
In automata theory and sequential logic, a state-transition table is a table showing what state (or states in the case of a nondeterministic finite automaton) a finite-state machine will move to, based on the current state and other inputs. It is essentially a truth table in which the inputs include the current state along with other inputs, and the outputs include the next state along with other outputs.
A state-transition table is one of many ways to specify a finite-state machine. Other ways include a state diagram.
