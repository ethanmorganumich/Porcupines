Monastic garden
||||||
A monastic garden was used by many people and for multiple purposes.  Gardening was the chief source of food for households, but also encompassed orchards, cemeteries and pleasure gardens, as well as providing plants for medicinal and cultural uses. For monasteries, gardens were especially important in supplying the monks livelihood.  Primarily due to the fact that many of the plants had multiple uses: for instance, peaches were used for closing wounds.
