Roosevelt Institute Campus Network
||||||
The Roosevelt Institute's Network, formerly the "Roosevelt Institute Campus Network" and the "Roosevelt Institution", bills itself as the first student-run policy organization in the United States. It is a part of the Roosevelt Institute, an organization focused on carrying forward the legacy of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt.
Individual chapters on college campuses conduct research and write policy regarding various public issues. In addition, chapters use Roosevelt's policy positions as a tool for systematic change in local communities across the country. Roosevelt also runs a paid summer internship program, publishes a yearly undergraduate journal series and undertakes state specific policy work.Roosevelt was founded at Stanford University and Yale University following the 2004 U.S. Presidential Election. Its name is a counterpoint to the conservative Hoover Institution at Stanford.
