Bosnian style in architecture
||||||
The Bosnian style in architecture is a specific architectural expression at the beginning of the 20th century, which evolved from the traditional architecture of Vienna Secession and from the awareness of the fact that the work originated in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
The Bosnian style can be compared with Scandinavian National Romanticism.
The Bosnian Style was championed by a younger generation of architects, like Czech architect Josip Pospišil (Josef Pospíšil), Slovene architect Rudolf Tönnies, and Austrian architect Ernst Lichtblau, who all studied at the Art Academy in Vienna with Karl von Hasenauer and Otto Wagner. The style was, however, named by Sarajevo’s senior architect, Josip Vancaš, for whom many of these younger architects worked.Although the Bosnian style was lauded as more sympathetic in its local inspiration, Gunzberger-Makas and Damljanovic-Conley argue that its stress remained on the Islamic component of Bosnian vernacular architecture, often with historical rather than contemporary sources. The shift from Moorish Revival to Bosnian Style was thus "the substitution of one historicist collage for another", in which pan-Islamic motifs were replaced with pan-vernacular motifs, ambiguously connecting Ottoman architecture with that of the present, and wrongly suggesting theses motives to be specifically Bosnian, while they are found throughout the Ottoman Balkans. The Bosnian Style may thus be "best understood as within the tradition of national romanticism", although its designers were not from within the nation they aimed to represent. As it still focused on the differences from Western and Central Europe, and it did not change the power relations about the scripted, imperial interpretations of local architecture, the Bosnian Style was no less Orientalist than Moorish Revival.
