Civil procedure~Privileged communication~

Work-product doctrine
||||||
In American civil procedure, the work-product doctrine protects materials prepared in anticipation of litigation from discovery by opposing counsel.  It is also known as the work-product rule, the work-product immunity, the work-product exception, and the work-product privilege, though there is debate about whether it is truly a "privilege."  This doctrine does not apply in other countries, where such communications are not protected, but where the legal discovery process itself is much more limited.
