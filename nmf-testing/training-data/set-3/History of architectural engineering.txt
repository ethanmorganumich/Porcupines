Architectural engineers apply and theoretical knowledge to the engineering design of buildings and building systems. The goal is to engineer high performance buildings that are sustainable, economically viable and ensure the safety health. 
Architectural engineering, also known as building engineering or architecture engineering, is an engineering discipline that deals with the technological aspects and multi-disciplinary. The responsibilities of an architectural engineer are designs, analyzing, and altering plans, or structures. They also assist team members with project objectives budgets and timelines. What it is required to be an architectural engineer is a bachelor's degree master's degree or/and professional engineering license and current knowledge of industry trends, technology, codes and regulation.
From reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to the construction of resilient buildings, architectural engineers are at the forefront of addressing several major challenges of the 21st century. They apply the latest scientific knowledge and technologies to the design of buildings. Architectural engineering as a relatively new licensed profession emerged in the 20th century as a result of the rapid technological developments. Architectural engineers are at the forefront of two major historical opportunities that today's world is immersed in: (1) that of rapidly advancing computer-technology, and (2) the parallel revolution arising from the need to create a sustainable planet.Distinguished from architecture as an art of design, architectural engineering is the art and science of engineering and construction as practiced in respect of buildings.
