Anti-Poverty Committee
||||||
The Anti-Poverty Committee (APC) was a militant left-wing anarchist organisation based in Vancouver, British Columbia that campaigned against poverty and homelessness.
The APC participated in direct action events such as sit-ins, squats, and vandalism to protest the closure of low-income housing projects and garnered considerable attention with disruptive protests centred on the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, including the instigation of a small-scale riot on the opening day of the games.
According to its website, the Anti-Poverty Committee was "an organization of poor and working people, who fight for poor people, their rights and an end to poverty by any means necessary." The APC ceased meeting in the summer of 2010, when they stopped renting an office space for meetings, and is no longer an active organization.
