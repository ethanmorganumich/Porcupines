Hopak

Hopak (Ukrainian: гопа́к, IPA: [ɦoˈpɑk]) is a Ukrainian folk dance originating as a male dance among the Zaporozhian Cossacks, but later danced by couples, male soloists, and mixed groups of dancers. It is performed most often as a solitary concert dance by amateur and professional Ukrainian dance ensembles, as well as other performers of folk dances. It has also been incorporated into larger artistic opuses such as operas, ballets and theatre. 
The hopak is often popularly referred to as the "National Dance of Ukraine" and has become very popular in Slavic countries, in particular Russia, Belarus and Poland. There are similar folkloric dance tunes known as Sirmpa in Leros, Greece.
