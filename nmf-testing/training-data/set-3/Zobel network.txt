For the wave filter invented by Zobel and sometimes named after him see m-derived filters.Zobel networks are a type of filter section based on the image-impedance design principle.  They are named after Otto Zobel of Bell Labs, who published a much-referenced paper on image filters in 1923.  The distinguishing feature of Zobel networks is that the input impedance is fixed in the design independently of the transfer function.  This characteristic is achieved at the expense of a much higher component count compared to other types of filter sections.  The impedance would normally be specified to be constant and purely resistive.  For this reason, Zobel networks are also known as constant resistance networks.  However, any impedance achievable with discrete components is possible.
Zobel networks were formerly widely used in telecommunications to flatten and widen the frequency response of copper land lines, producing a higher performance line from one originally intended for ordinary telephone use. Analogue technology has given way to digital technology and they are now little used.
When used to cancel out the reactive portion of loudspeaker impedance, the design is sometimes called a Boucherot cell. In this case, only half the network is implemented as fixed components, the other half being the real and imaginary components of the loudspeaker impedance.  This network is more akin to the power factor correction circuits used in electrical power distribution, hence the association with Boucherot's name.
A common circuit form of Zobel networks is in the form of a bridged T network.  This term is often used to mean a Zobel network, sometimes incorrectly when the circuit implementation is not a bridged T.
