Music of Seychelles
||||||
Seychelles, which is an independent island chain in the Indian Ocean, has a distinct kind of music. Folk music incorporates multiple influences in a syncretic fashion, including English contredanse, polka and mazurka, French folk and pop, sega from Mauritius and RÃ©union, taarab, zouk, soukous moutya and other pan-African genres, as well as Polynesian and Indian  music.  A complex form of percussion music called Kanmtole is popular, along with combinations of Sega and Reggae called Seggae and combinations of Moutya and Reggae called Mouggae, as is Montea, a fusion of native folk rhythms with Kenyan benga developed by Patrick Victor. Jean Marc Volcy is another famous Seychellois musician who has brought a modern touch to traditional music. He has several albums including Sove Lavi.
The growth of Seychelles music has since seen the adoption of a blend of contemporary reggae and mainstream, international popular music.
