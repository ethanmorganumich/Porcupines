Episcopal sandals

Episcopal sandals, also known as pontifical sandals, are a Catholic pontifical vestment worn by bishops when celebrating liturgical functions according to the preâ€“Vatican II rubrics, for example a Tridentine Solemn Pontifical Mass.
In shape, episcopal sandals are more like loafers than sandals. Liturgical stockings (caligae) are worn over the episcopal sandals and cover the episcopal sandals and the ankle. The sandals and stockings usually match the liturgical color of the Mass. However, when black vestments are worn, pontifical footwear is not used.
After the Second Vatican Council, the episcopal sandals fell out of common use and are not mentioned in the rubrics of the post-Vatican II Mass. They are primarily seen in the most solemn form of Tridentine Mass.
Episcopal sandals should not be confused with the velvet papal shoes, which Pope Benedict XVI reassumed. These evolved as the outdoor counterpart of the papal slippers, which are similar to the episcopal sandals, but are worn by the Pope outside liturgical functions and are always red.
