Cour d'honneur
||||||
A cour d'honneur (French: [kuʁ dɔnœʁ]; lit. '"court of honor"'; German: Ehrenhof) is the principal and formal approach and forecourt of a large building. It is usually defined by two secondary wings projecting forward from the main central block (corps de logis), sometimes with a fourth side, consisting of a low wing or a railing. The Palace of Versailles (illustration) and Blenheim Palace (plan) both feature such entrance courts.
