Vantage-point tree
||||||
A vantage-point tree (or VP tree) is a metric tree that segregates data in a metric space by choosing a position in the space (the "vantage point") and partitioning the data points into two parts: those points that are nearer to the vantage point than a threshold, and those points that are not. By recursively applying this procedure to partition the data into smaller and smaller sets, a tree data structure is created where neighbors in the tree are likely to be neighbors in the space.One generalization is called a multi-vantage-point tree, or MVP tree: a data structure for indexing objects from large metric spaces for similarity search queries. It uses more than one point to partition each level.
