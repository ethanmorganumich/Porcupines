SQL Slammer
||||||
SQL Slammer is a 2003 computer worm that caused a denial of service on some Internet hosts and dramatically slowed general Internet traffic. It spread rapidly, infecting most of its 75,000 victims within ten minutes.
The program exploited a buffer overflow bug in Microsoft's SQL Server and Desktop Engine database products. Although the MS02-039 patch had been released six months earlier, many organizations had not yet applied it.
The most infected regions were Europe, North America, and Asia (including East Asia and India).
