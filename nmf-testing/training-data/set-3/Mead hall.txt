Mead hall
||||||
Among the early Germanic peoples, a mead hall or feasting hall was a large building with a single room. From the fifth century to the Early Middle Ages such a building was the residence of a lord or king and his retainers. These structures were also where lords could formally receive visitors and where the community would gather to socialize, allowing lords to oversee the social activity of their subjects.
