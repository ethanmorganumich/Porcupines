Alcohol laws of Kansas
||||||
The alcohol laws of Kansas are among the strictest in the United States, in sharp contrast to its neighboring state of Missouri (see Alcohol laws of Missouri), and similar to (though somewhat less rigid than) its other neighboring state of Oklahoma (see Alcohol laws of Oklahoma). Legislation is enforced by the Kansas Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control.
Kansas had statewide prohibition from 1881 to 1948, longer than any other state, and continued to prohibit general on-premises liquor sales until 1987. Kansas's strict and highly regulated approach to alcohol stems from lingering vestiges of its long era of prohibition. As of January 2019, Kansas has 3 dry counties, where on-premises liquor sales are prohibited, but the sale of 3.2% beer is permitted.  As of April 2017, Kansas still has not ratified the 21st Amendment, which ended nationwide prohibition in 1933.
