IFACnet, the KnowledgeNet for Professional Accountants, was the global, multilingual search engine developed by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) and its members to provide professional accountants worldwide with one-stop access to good practice guidance, articles, management tools and other resources. This enterprise search engine was launched on October 2, 2006, by INDEZ. Originally marketed to professional accountants in business, IFACnet was expanded in March 2007 to provide resources and information relevant to small and medium accounting practices. In 2014, IFACnet was expanded and replaced by IFAC Knowledge Gateway, providing thought leadership and resources from IFAC and across the accountancy profession.
