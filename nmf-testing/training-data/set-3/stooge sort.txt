Stooge sort
||||||
Stooge sort is a recursive sorting algorithm. It is notable for its exceptionally bad time complexity of O(nlog 3 / log 1.5 ) = O(n2.7095...).
The running time of the algorithm is thus slower compared to reasonable sorting algorithms, and is slower than bubble sort, a canonical example of a fairly inefficient sort. It is however more efficient than Slowsort. The name comes from The Three Stooges.The algorithm is defined as follows:

If the value at the start is larger than the value at the end, swap them.
If there are 3 or more elements in the list, then:
Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list
Stooge sort the final 2/3 of the list
Stooge sort the initial 2/3 of the list againIt is important to get the integer sort size used in the recursive calls by rounding the 2/3 upwards, e.g. rounding 2/3 of 5 should give 4 rather than 3, as otherwise the sort can fail on certain data.
