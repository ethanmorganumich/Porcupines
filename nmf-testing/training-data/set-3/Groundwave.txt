Surface wave
||||||
In physics, a surface wave is a mechanical wave that propagates along the interface between differing media.  A common example is gravity waves along the surface of liquids, such as ocean waves.  Gravity waves can also occur within liquids, at the interface between two fluids with different densities.  Elastic surface waves can travel along the surface of solids, such as Rayleigh or Love waves.  Electromagnetic waves can also propagate as "surface waves" in that they can be guided along with a refractive index gradient or along an interface between two media having different dielectric constants. In radio transmission, a ground wave is a guided wave that propagates close to the surface of the Earth.
