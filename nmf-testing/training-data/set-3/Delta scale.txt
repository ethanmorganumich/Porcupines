Delta scale
||||||
The δ (delta) scale is a non-octave repeating musical scale. It may be regarded as the beta scale's reciprocal, since it is "as far 'down' the (0 3 6 9) circle from α as β is 'up'". As such it would split the minor second (presumably 16:15) into eight equal parts of approximately 14 cents each Play . This would total approximately 85.7 steps per octave.
The scale step may also precisely be derived from using 50:28 (25:14, 1003.8 cents, A♯, Play ) to approximate the interval 3:2⁄5:4, which equals 6:5 (E♭, 315.64 cents, Play ). Thus the step is approximately 13.946 cents, and there are 86.049 steps per octave.

The Bohlen–Pierce delta scale is based on the tritave and the 7:5:3 "wide" triad (Play ) and the 9:7:5 "narrow" triad (Play ) (rather than the conventional 4:5:6 triad). Notes include:
