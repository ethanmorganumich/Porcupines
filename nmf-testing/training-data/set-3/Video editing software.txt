Video editing software
||||||
Video editing software, or a video editor is software used performing the post-production video editing of digital video sequences on a non-linear editing system (NLE). It has replaced traditional flatbed celluloid film editing tools and analog video tape-to-tape online editing machines.
Video editing software serves a lot of purposes, such as filmmaking, audio commentary, and general editing of video content.
In NLE software, the user manipulates sections of video, images, and audio on a sequence. These clips can be trimmed, cut, and manipulated in many different ways. When editing is finished, the user exports the sequence as a video file.
