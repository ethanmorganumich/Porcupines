Heaps (data structures)~

Binomial heap
||||||
In computer science, a binomial heap is a data structure that acts as a priority queue but also allows pairs of heaps to be merged.
It is important as an implementation of the mergeable heap abstract data type (also called meldable heap), which is a priority queue supporting merge operation. It is implemented as a heap similar to a binary heap but using a special tree structure that is different from the complete binary trees used by binary heaps. Binomial heaps were invented in 1978 by Jean Vuillemin.
