Boardshorts
||||||
Boardshorts are a type of swimwear and casual wear in the form of relatively long (approximately knee length) loose-fitting shorts that are designed to be quick-drying and are generally made from strong and smooth polyester or nylon material. Originally known as surf trunks, later as Jams, and occasionally in British English as swim shorts, boardshorts are a style of men's and, more recently, women's summerwear.
Boardshorts have evolved over the last 50 years and separated themselves from the simpler swim trunks category from which they originated. In the beginning of their history, change happened organically â€“ individual solutions were born out of the need to address environmental requirements and inadequacies in a garment that was increasingly used specifically for surfing. Although they are now considered a popular form of general beachwear, much of today's mass consumer acceptance is based on competing brands marketing themselves as being authentic due to their historical roots within the surfing lifestyle and their product's technical authority.The name "boardshorts" is based on their use in aquatic sports that use a board, such as surfing. They are also sometimes called "boardies" first coined by Body Glove in 1953 slang, especially in Australia, and "baggies" in South Africa.
Boardshorts are especially popular in North America and spread beyond surfing especially as the skater punk fashion trend got underway.  They are also typically worn in men's beach volleyball. They are less popular in other parts of the world, where other suit styles are preferred.
