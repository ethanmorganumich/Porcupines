The Architecture of Gujarat consists of architecture in the Indian state of Gujarat.
The first major civilization in Gujarat was the Harappan Civilization. Their settlements, including Dholvaira and Lothal are characteristic of Harappan architecture. 
Islamic architecture flourished during the rule of the Gujarat Sultanate and Mughal Empire in Gujarat. Buildings were built in European styles, including Gothic and Neoclassical during the British Colonial period. Indo-Saracenic architecture also developed during this period. After independence in 1947, modernist architecture is seen in Gujarat.
