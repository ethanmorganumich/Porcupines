Bathing dress
||||||
A bathing dress was a mode of dress used for ladies' swimming/bathing activities during the 19th century. These bathing costumes originally included ankle length dresses, long pants, and long sleeves. Around the 1880s the sleeves and hemlines of these dresses were shortened to improve range of motion and general comfort.
