The household is the basic unit of analysis in many social, microeconomic and government models, and is important to economics and inheritance.Household models include families, blended families, shared housing, group homes, boarding houses, houses of multiple occupancy (UK), and single room occupancy (US). In feudal societies, the royal household and medieval households of the wealthy included servants and other retainers.
