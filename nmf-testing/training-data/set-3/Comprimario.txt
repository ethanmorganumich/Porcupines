Comprimario
||||||
A comprimario is a small supporting role in an opera (or a singer who sings those roles). The word is derived from the Italian "con primario", or "with the primary", meaning that the comprimario role (or singer) is not a principal role (or singer).  The term usually refers to characters who do not sing any full-length arias or long scenes (although mute characters who do not sing at all, are not considered comprimarios).
Many singers began their careers as comprimario singers; many others end their careers that way when they become too infirm to cope with long roles; some have made a career out of singing such parts.  Among these latter are singers such as Anthony Laciura, Jean Kraft, Nico Castel and Charles Anthony of the Metropolitan Opera; others include Plinio Clabassi and Karl DÃ¶nch.
