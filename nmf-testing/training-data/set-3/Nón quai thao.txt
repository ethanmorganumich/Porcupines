The Ba tầm hat or nón Ba tầm (Chữ Nôm: 𥶄𠀧尋, "hat of three cubits") is a traditional Vietnamese flat palm hat. It should be distinguished from other traditional Vietnamese headwear such as the conical nón lá and the coiled khăn vấn. 
Ba tầm hat was worn in traditional Vietnam by women, as an accessory to finer garments, as opposed to the more functional clothes associated with farm work. Until the early 20th century, this hat was widespread in Northern Vietnam.
The hat, when worn by mediums, traditionally had silver ornaments hanging from silk strings around the brim.
