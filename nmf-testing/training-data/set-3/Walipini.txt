Walipini
||||||
A walipini is an earth-sheltered cold frame. It derives its name from the Aymaran languages. It shares concept with the pineapple pit, that was used, as the name implies to cultivate pineapple especially, alongside other exotic fruits all the way back in Victorian era Britain and even in the cold plains of pre revolution Russia.
In Soviet Union era, similar techniques were developed to grow Citrus fruits (oranges, lemons, mandarins, tangerines, grapefruits, limes, pomeloes) at temperatures of minus 30 degrees Celsius. By 1950, the Soviet Union boasted 30,000 hectares of citrus plantations, producing 200,000 tonnes of fruits per year.The walipini is seeing a modern renaissance as it allows for crops to be grown in greenhouse-like settings, whilst requiring little to no heating, and thus is attractive to practitioners of permaculture and the sustainability movement.
