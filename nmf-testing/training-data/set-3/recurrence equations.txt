Recurrence relation
||||||
In mathematics, a recurrence relation is an equation according to which the 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  th term of a sequence of numbers is equal to some combination of the previous terms. Often, only 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   previous terms of the sequence appear in the equation, for a parameter 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   that is independent of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  ; this number 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is called the order of the relation. If the values of the first 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   numbers in the sequence have been given, the rest of the sequence can be calculated by repeatedly applying the equation.
In linear recurrences, the nth term is equated to a linear function of the 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   previous terms. A famous example is the recurrence for the Fibonacci numbers,

where the order 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is two and the linear function merely adds the two previous terms. This example is a linear recurrence with constant coefficients, because the coefficients of the linear function (1 and 1) are constants that do not depend on 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . For these recurrences, one can express the general term of the sequence as a closed-form expression of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . As well, linear recurrences with polynomial coefficients depending on 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   are also important, because many common elementary and special functions have a Taylor series whose coefficients satisfy such a recurrence relation (see holonomic function).
Solving a recurrence relation means obtaining a closed-form solution: a non-recursive function of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  .
The concept of a recurrence relation can be extended to multidimensional arrays, that is, indexed families that are indexed by tuples of natural numbers.
