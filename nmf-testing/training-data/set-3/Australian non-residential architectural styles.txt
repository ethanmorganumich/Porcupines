Australian non-residential architectural styles
||||||
Australian non-residential architectural styles are a set of Australian architectural styles that apply to buildings used for purposes other than residence and have been around only since the first colonial government buildings of early European settlement of Australia in 1788.
Their distribution follows closely the establishment and growth of the different colonies of Australia, in that the earliest colonial buildings can be found in New South Wales and Tasmania.
The classifications set out below are derived from a leading Australian text.
