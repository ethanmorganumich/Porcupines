Maashaus
||||||
Maashaus (German: Ma√ühaus) is a spacious room taking the whole front part of a ground floor of a multi-storied Gothic or Renaissance town house.
This room was used mainly for serving beer, or other kinds of trade and craft. It was not heated. It also worked to link together other parts of the house, since it held a staircase to the first floor above ground (where the owner lived) and to the basement, an archway or similar passage to the courtyard and so on. The ceiling was almost always vaulted and was often supported by an asymmetrically placed central column. It was separated from the street or the arcade by a wall with a doorway and one or more windows.
