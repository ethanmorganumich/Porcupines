Krakeb
||||||
Qraqeb or garagab (Arabic: قراقب), in English often transliterated as krakeb, are a large iron castanet-like musical instrument primarily used as the rhythmic aspect of Gnawa music.  Gnawa today is part of the North African culture and is inherent in the Maghrebi soundscape. The word qraqeb is a plural form (with the singular being qarqab), with an unclear etyomology, as the word does not occur in Standard Arabic with this meaning.
