Graphiq (formerly FindTheBest) is a semantic technology company that uses artificial intelligence to rapidly create interactive data-driven infographics. Its intent is similar to Wolfram Alpha which is designed to provide users with direct information on a variety of subjects rather than going through a search engine.
Graphiq is based in Santa Barbara, California and has raised $32 million in total funding from venture funding companies by 2013.In May 2017, Amazon acquired Graphiq for an estimated $50 million.
Graphiq announced that its features for news publishers would no longer be available on July 21, 2017, as part of the transition.
