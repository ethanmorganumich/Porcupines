Belly chain
||||||
A belly chain or waist chain is the popular English term for the Indian jewelry called kamarband. The belly chain is a type of body jewelry worn around the waist. Some belly chains attach to a navel piercing; these are also called "pierced belly chains". They are often made of silver or gold. Sometimes a thread is used around the waist instead of a chain. The chain may be delicate and thin, or heavy and thick.
Belly chains are considered auspicious for women in Indian culture.
