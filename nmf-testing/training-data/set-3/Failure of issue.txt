Failure of issue
||||||
In property law, a failure of issue is a situation in which a property-holder dies without leaving children who could have inherited their property. Before the nineteenth century, common law courts recognized a system of property laws where title would revert to the original grantor upon the failure of issue, but modern laws now permit property to pass to third parties when grantees no longer have living heirs to inherit the property.
