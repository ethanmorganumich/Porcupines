Stale seed bed
||||||
The stale seed bed or false seed bed method is a weed control technique used at both the farm and garden scales. In this  that the young weeds can then be easily eliminated. By destroying them early, the farmer or gardener eliminates most of that season's annual weeds, which reduces their labor and improves their crop yields.
