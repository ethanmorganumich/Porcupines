MassResistance is a hate group that promotes anti-LGBT and socially conservative positions. The group is designated an anti-LGBT hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, in part for claims linking LGBT people with pedophilia and zoophilia, and claims that suicide prevention programs aimed at gay youth were created by homosexual activists to normalize and "lure" children into homosexuality.MassResistance says it "provides the information and guidance people need to confront assaults on the traditional family, school children, and the moral foundation of society". The groups activism takes several forms, including promoting its views via its website, blog, email, lobbying, and voters' guides. It has also provided support for anti-gay activism in foreign countries such as Taiwan and Australia.MassResistance was founded by Brian Camenker in 1995 as the Parents' Rights Coalition, and in 2003 it changed its name to Article 8 Alliance. It adopted its current name, MassResistance, in 2006.
