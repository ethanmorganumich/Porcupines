Roof pitch
||||||
Roof pitch is the steepness of a roof expressed as a ratio of inch(es) rise per horizontal foot (or their metric equivalent), or as the angle in degrees its surface deviates from the horizontal.  A flat roof has a pitch of zero in either instance; all other roofs are pitched.
A roof that rises 3 inches per foot, for example, would be described as having a pitch of 3 (or “3 in 12”).
