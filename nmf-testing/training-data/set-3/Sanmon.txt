Sanmon
||||||
A sanmon (三門 or 山門), also called sangedatsumon (三解脱門, lit. "gate of the three liberations"), is the most important gate of a Japanese Zen Buddhist temple, and is part of the Zen shichidō garan, the group of buildings that forms the heart of a Zen Buddhist temple. It can be often found in temples of other denominations too. Most sanmon are 2- or 3-bay nijūmon (a type of two-storied gate), but the name by itself does not imply any specific architecture.
