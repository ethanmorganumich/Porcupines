||||||
YouTube is an American video-sharing website headquartered in San Bruno, California. Although the most-viewed videos were initially viral videos, such as "Evolution of Dance" and "Charlie Bit My Finger", the most-viewed videos were increasingly related to music videos. Since Lady Gaga's "Bad Romance" in 2009, every video that has reached the top of the "most-viewed YouTube videos" list has been a music video. Some of the previously most-viewed videos are no longer available on the site.
In November 2005, a Nike advertisement featuring Brazilian football player Ronaldinho became the first video to reach 1,000,000 views.The billion-view mark was first passed by Gangnam Style in December 2012.
On January 13, 2022, Pinkfong's "Baby Shark" became the first video to hit 10,000,000,000 views.
