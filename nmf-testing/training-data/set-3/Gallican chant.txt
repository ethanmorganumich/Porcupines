Gallican chant
||||||
Gallican chant refers to the liturgical plainchant repertory of the Gallican rite of the Roman Catholic Church in Gaul, prior to the introduction and development of elements of the Roman rite from which Gregorian chant evolved.  Although the music was largely lost, traces are believed to remain in the Gregorian corpus.
