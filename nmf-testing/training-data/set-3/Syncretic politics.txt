Syncretic politics
||||||
Syncretic politics, or spectral-syncretic politics, combine elements from across the conventional leftâ€“right political spectrum. The idea of syncretic politics has been influenced by syncretism and syncretic religion. The main idea of syncretic politics is that taking political positions of neutrality by combining elements associated with left-wing politics and right-wing politics can achieve a goal of reconciliation.
