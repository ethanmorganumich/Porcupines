Turoyo (Syriac: ܛܘܪܝܐ) (Ṭūr ‘Abdinian Aramaic), also referred to as modern Surayt (Syriac: ܣܘܪܝܬ), or modern Suryoyo (Syriac: ܣܘܪܝܝܐ), is a Central Neo-Aramaic language traditionally spoken in the Tur Abdin region in southeastern Turkey and in northern Syria.  Turoyo speakers are mostly adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church, but there are also some Turoyo-speaking adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church, especially from the towns of Midyat and Qamishli. The language is also spoken throughout diaspora, among modern Syriacs. It is classified as a vulnerable language. Most speakers use the Classical Syriac language for literature and worship.  Turoyo is not mutually intelligible with Western Neo-Aramaic, having been separated for over a thousand years; its closest relatives are Mlaḥsô and western varieties of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic like Suret.
