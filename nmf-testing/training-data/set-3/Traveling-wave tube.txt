A traveling-wave tube (TWT, pronounced "twit") or traveling-wave tube amplifier (TWTA, pronounced "tweeta") is a specialized vacuum tube that is used in electronics to amplify radio frequency (RF) signals in the microwave range. The TWT belongs to a category of "linear beam" tubes, such as the klystron, in which the radio wave is amplified by absorbing power from a beam of electrons as it passes down the tube.  Although there are various types of TWT, two major categories are:
Helix TWT - in which the radio waves interact with the electron beam while traveling down a wire helix which surrounds the beam.  These have wide bandwidth, but output power is limited to a few hundred watts.
Coupled cavity TWT - in which the radio wave interacts with the beam in a series of cavity resonators through which the beam passes.  These function as narrowband power amplifiers.A major advantage of the TWT over some other microwave tubes is its ability to amplify a wide range of frequencies i.e. a large bandwidth.  The bandwidth of the helix TWT can be as high as two octaves, while the cavity versions have bandwidths of 10â€“20%.  Operating frequencies range from 300 MHz to 50 GHz. The power gain of the tube is on the order of 40 to 70 decibels, and output power ranges from a few watts to megawatts.TWTs account for over 50% of the sales volume of all microwave vacuum tubes.   They are widely used as the power amplifiers and oscillators in radar systems, communication satellite and spacecraft transmitters, and electronic warfare systems.
