Seed saving
||||||
In agriculture and gardening, seed saving (sometimes known as brown bagging) is the practice of saving seeds or other reproductive material (e.g. tubers) from vegetables, grain, herbs, and flowers for use from year to year for annuals and nuts, tree fruits, and berries for perennials and trees.  This is the traditional way farms and gardens were maintained for the last 12,000 years (see first agricultural revolution).
In recent decades, beginning in the latter part of the 20th century, there has been a major shift to purchasing seed annually from commercial seed suppliers.  Much of the grassroots seed-saving activity today is the work of home gardeners.
