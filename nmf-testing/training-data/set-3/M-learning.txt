M-learning or mobile learning is "learning across multiple contexts, through social and content interactions, using personal electronic devices".: page 4  A form of distance education, m-learners use mobile device educational technology at their convenience time.M-learning technologies include handheld computers, MP3 players, notebooks, mobile phones, and tablets. M-learning focuses on the mobility of the learner, interacting with portable technologies. Using mobile tools for creating learning aids and materials becomes an important part of informal learning.M-learning is convenient in that it is accessible virtually anywhere. Sharing is almost instantaneous among everyone using the same content, which leads to the reception of instant feedback and tips. M-learning also brings strong portability by replacing books and notes with small devices filled with tailored learning contents. M-learning has the added benefit of being cost-effective, as the price of digital content on tablets is falling sharply compared to traditional media (books, CDs, DVDs, etc.). One digital textbook, for instance, costs one-third to half the price of a paper textbook (AFD, 2012), with zero marginal cost.According to Fombona, Pascual-Sevillana, and González-Videgaray, this methodology offers some possibilities, such as greater and different access to information. It also offers transcendent innovations, such as the increase of informal and playful activities, iconic virtual membership, and networks of friendly interaction within new scales of values.
