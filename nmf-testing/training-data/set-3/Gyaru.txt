Gyaru (Japanese: ギャル), is a Japanese fashion subculture. The term gyaru is a Japanese transliteration of the English slang word gal.The term for gyaru was introduced in Japan by the American jeans company Lee, who introduced a new line of jeans to their brand Wrangler. When the women's jeans line 'GALS' was released in the 1970s; the term had been quickly used outside of its original branding and was adopted to describe the gyaru fashion by 1972. Gyaru subculture was at its peak during the Heisei era. It had a large influence on Japanese fashion and its economy, its international economy, and its global soft power across the world through Cool Japan such as in Southeast Asia and internationally. Multiple gyaru brands branched out before eventually declining due to financial instability and changes in its target demographic. The terms usage peaked in the early 2000s and has gradually declined since.This decline has been attributed to shifts in magazine industry, the exaggeration of the style in terms of its style use and progression, western media, and government policies. The meaning of the term gyaru gradually drifted to apply to a slightly older demographic whose apparent lack of interest in work or marriage resulted in these women being regarded as childish or as a hussy. Due to its past and its present connotation, it is now used almost interchangeably with kogyaru; as the name of kogyaru and its history is intertwined with the gyaru fashion subculture. Even though Japanese citizens have seen the style of gyaru from birth, impact, and decline, citizens have stated to have never had the intention of imitating the American style of daily apparel or of wanting to resemble it. Yet, it can be stated that this very same sentiment is argued against by other Japanese citizens.The department store Shibuya 109, across the intersection from the Shibuya station in Tokyo, was a popular location for purchasing gyaru style clothing and was where this fashion subculture was most often seen. In the early 2000s, Shibuya 109 was considered the source of the newest and trendiest items or brands for gyaru, from popular and largely recognized gyaru brands to more independent local designers within that department store. Although 109 began as the primary source of gyaru style clothing, the style's growth in popularity saw brands branching out, having different brands of clothing being available at pop up stores, in conventions or through web shops that offered international shipping. Second hand and vending of gyaru apparel and accessories also increased their availability.
