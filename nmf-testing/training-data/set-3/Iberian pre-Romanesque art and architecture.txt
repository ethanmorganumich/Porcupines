Iberian pre-Romanesque art and architecture

The Pre-Romanesque art and architecture of the Iberian Peninsula (in Spanish, arte prerrománico; in Portuguese, arte pré-românica) refers to the art of Spain and Portugal after the Classical Age and before Romanesque art and architecture; hence the term Pre-Romanesque.
Visigothic art, the art of the Visigoths to 711, is usually classified as Migration Period art by art historians to emphasis its Germanic connections and origins; but can also classified as Pre-Romanesque, particularly in Spain, to emphasis its lineage in Spanish history.
