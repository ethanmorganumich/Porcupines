Townsite
||||||
A townsite is a legal subdivision of land for the development of a town or community.  In the historical development of the United States, Canada, and other former British colonial nations, the filing of a townsite plat (United States) or plan (Canada) was often the first legal act in the establishment of a new town or community.
