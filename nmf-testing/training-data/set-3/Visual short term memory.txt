Short-term memory
||||||
Short-term memory  (or "primary" or "active memory") is the capacity for holding a small amount of information in an active, readily available state for a short interval. For example, short-term memory holds a phone number that has just been recited. The duration of short-term memory (absent rehearsal or active maintenance) is estimated to be on the order of seconds. The commonly cited capacity of 7 items, found in Miller's Law, has been superseded by 4Â±1 items. In contrast, long-term memory holds information indefinitely.
Short-term memory is not the same as working memory, which refers to structures and processes used for temporarily storing and manipulating information.
