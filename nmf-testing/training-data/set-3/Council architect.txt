A council architect or municipal architect (properly titled county architect, borough architect, city architect or district architect) is an architect employed by a local authority.  The name of the position varies depending on the type of local authority and is similar to that of county surveyor or chief engineer used by some authorities.  Council architects are employed in the United Kingdom but also used in Malta and Ireland.
