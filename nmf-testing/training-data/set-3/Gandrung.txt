Gandrung (Javanese: ꦒꦤ꧀ꦝꦿꦸꦁ; Osing: Gandrong; Balinese: ᬕᬦ᭄ᬤ᭄ᬭᬸᬂ; Petjo: Gandroeng) is a traditional dance from Indonesia. Gandrung has many variations and is popular in Bali, Lombok and Eastern Java among the Balinese, Sasak and Javanese (especially the Osing Javanese). The most popular variation is gandrung from the Banyuwangi region  in the eastern peninsula of Java, so much that the city is often referred as Kota Gandrung or "the city of gandrung".
Originally a ritual dance dedicated to the goddess of rice and fertility, Dewi Sri, it is currently performed as a social dance of courtship and love in communal and social events, or as a tourist attraction. Gandrung Sewu Festival is held at Banyuwangi annually.
