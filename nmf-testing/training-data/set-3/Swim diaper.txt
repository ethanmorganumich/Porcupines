Swim diaper
||||||
A swim diaper or swim nappy is a diaper that is made for those who have fecal incontinence (usually babies or toddlers), which is worn underneath a bathing suit, or as a bathing suit. Swim diapers can be reusable and disposable. They are not intended to be absorbent, but only to contain solid waste (feces); the lack of absorbency prevents the swim diaper from swelling with water.
