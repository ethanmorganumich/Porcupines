Carpet bag
||||||
A carpet bag is a top-opening travelling bag made of carpet, commonly from an oriental rug. It was a popular form of luggage in the United States and Europe in the 19th century, featuring simple handles and only an upper frame, which served as its closure. Some small modern versions are used as handbags or purses.
The Reconstruction-era carpet bag illustrated is made from a remnant of Printed Tapestry Velvet Carpet (Whytock ; patent 1832, Edinburgh). Extant examples of this style of carpet can be seen at Hampton National Historic Site: National Park Service: Towson, Maryland, and Andrew Jacksons Hermitage in Nashville, Tennessee, USA.
A United Kingdom extant installation can be seen at  Burton Constable Hall, in Yorkshire.
