The kaupinam, kaupina, langot or lungooty (langoṭī) is a loincloth worn by men in the Indian subcontinent as underclothing, it is now commonly worn by South Asian pehlwano wrestlers while exercising or sparring in a dangal. It is made up of a rectangular strip of cotton cloth used to cover the genitals with the help of the strings, connected to the four ends of the cloth for binding it around the waist. 
The small lungooty worn by naga sadhus or fakirs is also known as ''Coopees''.
