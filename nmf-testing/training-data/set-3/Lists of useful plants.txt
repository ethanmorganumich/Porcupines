Lists of useful plants
||||||
This article contains a list of useful plants, meaning a plant that has been or can be co-opted by humans to fulfill a particular need.  Rather than listing all plants on one page, this page instead collects the lists and categories for the different ways in which a plant can be used; some plants may fall into several of the categories or lists below, and some lists overlap (for example, the term "crop" covers both edible and non-edible agricultural products).
