Plastic pants

Plastic pants (also known as Waterproof Pants, Plastic Panties, Diaper Dover's, Nappy Covers, Dry Joggers, Nappy Wraps, Wraps, or Pilchers) are devices worn over a diaper with the purpose of containing liquid or solid waste that could leak through the fabric. They are waterproof with a plastic feel, rather than the soft napkin feel. Today, plastic pants are usually made out of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or polyurethane (PU). 
The availability of inexpensive, and easily manufactured, man-made waterproof materials since the 1950s has significantly improved the quality of life of those with continence problems.
