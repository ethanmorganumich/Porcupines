Faith

Faith, derived from Latin fides and Old French feid, is confidence or trust in a person, thing, or concept. In the context of religion, one can define faith as "belief in God or in the doctrines or teachings of religion".
Religious people often think of faith as confidence based on a perceived degree of warrant, or evidence 
while others who are more skeptical of religion tend to think of faith as simply belief without evidence.
