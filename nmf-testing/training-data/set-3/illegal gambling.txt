Gaming law
||||||
Gaming law is the set of rules and regulations that apply to the gaming or gambling industry. Gaming law is not a branch of law in the traditional sense but rather is a collection of several areas of law that include criminal law, regulatory law, constitutional law, administrative law, company law, contract law, and in some jurisdictions, competition law. At common law, gambling requires consideration, chance and prize, legal terms that must be analyzed by gaming lawyers within the context of any gaming operation.Gaming law is enormously complex. In the United States, it involves federal and state law considerations. In Canada, it involves federal and provincial law considerations, in a variety of legal disciplines.
