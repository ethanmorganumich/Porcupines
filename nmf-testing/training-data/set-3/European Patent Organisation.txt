The European Patent Organisation (sometimes abbreviated EPOrg in order to distinguish it from the European Patent Office, one of the two organs of the organisation) is a public international organisation created in 1977 by its contracting states to grant patents in Europe under the European Patent Convention (EPC) of 1973. The European Patent Organisation has its seat at Munich, Germany, and has administrative and financial autonomy. The organisation is independent from the European Union, and has as member states all 27 EU member states along with 12 other European states.The evolution of the Organisation is inherently linked to that of the European Patent Convention. See European Patent Convention for the history of the European patent system as set up by the European Patent Convention, operated by the European Patent Office, and supervised by the Administrative Council of the European Patent Organisation.
