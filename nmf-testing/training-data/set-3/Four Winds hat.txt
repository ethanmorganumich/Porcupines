Four Winds hat
||||||
The Four Winds hat (in Northern Sami čiehgahpir) is one version of traditional man's hat of the Sami. The basis is a simple blue cylinder, decorated with a band with braid patterns, but the top is a large, four-cornered star, colored bright blue with parts bright red and yellow. The decoration in an actual Sami hat is, like the rest of the Sami garb, indicative of the person's place of origin or even his clan or marital status, much like the Scottish tartan.
