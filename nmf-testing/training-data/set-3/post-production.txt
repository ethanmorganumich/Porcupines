Post-production

Post-production is part of the process of filmmaking, video production, audio production, and photography. Post-production includes all stages of production occurring after principle photography or recording individual program segments. The first part of the post-production process is the traditional non-linear (analog) film editing at the outset of post-production has mostly been replaced by digital or video editing software that operates as a non-linear editing (NLE) system. The advantage of being able to have this non-linear capacity is in the flexibility for editing scenes out of order, making creative changes at will, carefully shaping the film in a thoughtful, meaningful way for emotional effect.
Once the production team is satisfied with the picture editing, the picture editing is said to be "locked."  At this point begins the turnover process, where the picture is prepared for lab and color finishing and the sound is "spotted" and turnover to the composer and sound designers for sound design, composing and sound mixing.
