Burkini
||||||
A burkini (or burqini; portmanteau of burqa and bikini, though qualifying as neither of these garments) is a style of swimsuit for women. The suit covers the whole body except the face, the hands and the feet, while being light enough for swimming. The amount of skin covered is about the same as the person wearing a wetsuit and a swimming cap.The design is intended to respect Islamic traditions of modest dress. It is also worn for protection from the sun.
The burkini was originally designed in Australia by Aheda Zanetti. Zanetti's company Ahiida owns the trademarks to the words burkini and burqini, but they are sometimes used as generic terms for similar forms of swimwear.In 2016, a number of French municipalities banned the wearing of burkinis, which sparked international controversy and accusations of Islamophobia.  The resulting publicity caused a significant increase in sales, especially sales to non-Muslims  and to survivors of skin cancer.  Before then, Zanetti's company had sold about 700,000 burkinis worldwide.
