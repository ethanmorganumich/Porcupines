Music of Tibet
||||||
The music of Tibet reflects the cultural heritage of the trans-Himalayan region centered in Tibet, but also known wherever ethnic Tibetan groups are found in Nepal, Bhutan, India and further abroad. The religious music of Tibet reflects the profound influence of Tibetan Buddhism on the culture.
The new-age 'singing bowl' music marketed in the West as 'Tibetan music' is of 1970s US origin.
