Ballet Folklórico de Honduras Oro Lenca is a Honduran folkloric ballet troupe in La Esperanza. It was founded in 2008 and presents dances and costumes that reflect the traditional culture of Honduras. This dance troupe hosts an annual folk dance festival, El Grande de Grandes, and represents Honduran culture internationally. It also mentors nascent dance groups in villages, towns, and cities of Honduras. In November 2015, the National Congress of Honduras designated Ballet Folklórico Oro Lenca Patrimonio Cultural de la Nación (cultural heritage of the nation), and subsequently designated Ambassadors of Art and Culture by executive decree.The original name of the group was Ballet Folklórico Oro Lenca. In 2016, the group was registered in Honduras as a non-profit organization under its current name of Ballet Folklórico de Honduras Oro Lenca. In the name, Oro Lenca (Lenca Gold) references the indigenous Lenca people that enrich the culture of Intibucá. The dance group's performances, relating to Honduran and indigenous dance and culture, are meant to resurrect and sustain the historical indigenous, creole and colonial traditions of the region. Ballet Folklórico refers to traditional dance in Honduras that began its resurgence in the 1950s, initiated by the work of Honduran folklorist and native son of La Esperanza, Rafael Manzanares Aguilar.
