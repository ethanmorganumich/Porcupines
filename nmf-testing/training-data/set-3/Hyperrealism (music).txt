Hyperrealism is a term coined by the composer Noah Creshevsky to describe a musical language for his and his colleagues' compositional aesthetic.  Creshevsky defines this language as "Hyperrealism is an electroacoustic musical language constructed from sounds that are found in our shared environment ("realism"), handled in ways that are somehow exaggerated or excessive ("hyper")."
