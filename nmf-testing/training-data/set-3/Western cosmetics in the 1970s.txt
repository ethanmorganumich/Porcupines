Western cosmetics in the 1970s
||||||
Western cosmetics in the 1970s reflected the multiple roles ascribed to the modern woman. For the first time since 1900, make-up was chosen situationally, rather than in response to monolithic trends. The era's two primary visions were the feminist-influenced daytime "natural look" and the sexualized evening aesthetic presented by European designers and fashion photographers. In the periphery, punk and glam were also influential.  The struggling cosmetics industry attempted to make a comeback, using new marketing and manufacturing practices.
