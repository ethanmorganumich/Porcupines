||||||
The Information Age (also known as the Computer Age, Digital Age, Silicon Age, or New Media Age) is a historical period that began in the mid-20th century, characterized by a rapid epochal shift from traditional industry established by the Industrial Revolution to an economy primarily based upon information technology. The onset of the Information Age has been associated with the development of the transistor in 1947, the basic building block of modern electronics, the optical amplifier in 1957, the basis of long-distance fiber optic communications, and Unix time measured from the start of Jan. 1, 1970, the basis of Coordinated Universal Time and Network Time Protocol which now synchronizes all computers connected to the Internet. 
According to the United Nations Public Administration Network, the Information Age was formed by capitalizing on computer microminiaturization advances, which led to modernized information systems and internet communications as the driving force of social evolution.
