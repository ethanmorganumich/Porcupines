Fantastic architecture
||||||
Fantastic architecture is an architectural style featuring attention-grabbing buildings. Such buildings can be considered as works of art, and are normally built purely for the amusement of its owner. Architects that employed this style include Antoni Gaud√≠, Bruno Taut, and Hans Poelzig.Fantastic architecture should not be confused with novelty architecture. While both styles have unusual, attention-grabbing designs, novelty architecture is meant to be an advertisement for the business inside, such as buildings with a giant donut on the roof. Fantastic architecture, on the other hand, serves no other purpose than the personal amusement of its builder.
