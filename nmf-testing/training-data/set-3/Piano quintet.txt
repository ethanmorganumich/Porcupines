Piano quintet
||||||
In classical music, a piano quintet is a work of chamber music written for piano and four other instruments, most commonly a string quartet (i.e., two violins, viola, and cello). The term also refers to the group of musicians that plays a piano quintet. The genre particularly flourished during the nineteenth century.
Until the middle of the nineteenth century, most piano quintets were scored for piano, violin, viola, cello, and double bass. Following the success of Robert Schumann's Piano Quintet in E♭ major, Op. 44 in 1842, which paired the piano with a string quartet, composers increasingly adopted Schumann's instrumentation, and it was this form of the piano quintet that dominated during the second half of the nineteenth century and into the twentieth century.
Among the best known and most frequently performed piano quintets, aside from Schumann's, are those by Franz Schubert, Johannes Brahms, César Franck, Antonín Dvořák and Dmitri Shostakovich.
