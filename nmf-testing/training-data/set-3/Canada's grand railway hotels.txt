Canada's grand railway hotels
||||||
Canada's grand railway hotels are a series of railway hotels across the country, each a local and national landmark, and most of which are icons of Canadian history and architecture; some are considered to be the grand hotels of the British Empire. Each hotel was originally built by the Canadian railway companies, or the railways acted as a catalyst for the hotel's construction.  The hotels were designed to serve the passengers of the country's then expanding rail network and they celebrated rail travel in style.
