Webbed belt
||||||
A webbed belt, military belt, or skater belt is a type of belt, normally made of webbing, distinguished by its belt buckle design and lack of holes in the cord, which is usually found in other belts where a pin is used as the fastening mechanism in the belt buckle. A belt of this type is often used in the uniforms of armed forces as well as that of the Boy Scouts of America, since it is adjustable, cheap to produce and does not deteriorate easily.
