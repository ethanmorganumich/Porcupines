Azekura-zukuri
||||||
Azekura-zukuri (校倉造) or azekura is a Japanese architectural style of simple wooden construction, used for storehouses (kura), granaries, and other utilitarian structures.  This style probably dates to the early centuries of the Common Era, such as during the Yayoi or Kofun periods. It is characterized by joined-log structures of triangular cross-section, and commonly built of cypress timbers.
