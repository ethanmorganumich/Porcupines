The East Asian hip-and-gable roof (Xiēshān (歇山) in Chinese, Irimoya (入母屋) in Japanese, Paljakjibung (팔작지붕) in Korean) also known as 'resting hill roof', consists of a hip roof that slopes down on all four sides and integrates a gable on two opposing sides. It is usually constructed with two large sloping roof sections in the front and back respectively, while each of the two sides is usually constructed with a smaller roof section.The style is Chinese in origin, and has spread across much of Asia. The original style and similar styles are found in the traditional architectures of India, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, Mongolia, Tibet, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Kalmykia. It also influenced the style of the bahay na bato of the Philippines.
