Crown molding
||||||
Crown moulding is a form of cornice created out of decorative moulding installed atop an interior wall.  It is also used atop doors, windows, pilasters and cabinets.
Historically made of plaster or wood, modern crown moulding installation may be of a single element, or a build-up of multiple components into a more elaborate whole.
