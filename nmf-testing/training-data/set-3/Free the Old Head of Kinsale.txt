Old Head of Kinsale
||||||
The Old Head of Kinsale (Irish: An Seancheann) is a headland near Kinsale, County Cork, Ireland.
A castle has been on the headland since at least the 3rd century, with the current iteration built in 1223. An early lighthouse was established here in the 17th century by Robert Reading. The area is the nearest point of land to where the RMS Lusitania was sunk in 1915, 18 km (11 miles) from the site of the sinking. Currently, access to the Old Head is restricted as it is on the site of a private golf course, which has proven to be controversial.
