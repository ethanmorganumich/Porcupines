Anti-cult movement
||||||
The anti-cult movement (ACM; or the countercult movement) consists of various governmental and non-governmental organizations and individuals that seek to raise awareness of cults, uncover coercive practices used to attract and retain members, and help those who have become involved with harmful cult practices. One element within the anti-cult movement, Christian counter-cult organizations, oppose New Religious Movements on theological grounds, categorizing them as cults, and distribute information to this effect through church networks and via printed literature.
