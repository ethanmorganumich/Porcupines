Purlin
||||||
A purlin (or historically purline, purloyne, purling, perling) is a longitudinal, horizontal, structural member in a roof.  In traditional timber framing there are three basic types of purlin: purlin plate, principal purlin, and common purlin.
Purlins also appear in steel frame construction. Steel purlins may be painted or greased for protection from the environment.
