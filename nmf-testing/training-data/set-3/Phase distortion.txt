Phase distortion
||||||
In signal processing, phase distortion or phase-frequency distortion is distortion, that is, change in the shape of the waveform,  that occurs when (a) a filter's phase response is not linear over the frequency range of interest, that is, the phase shift introduced by a circuit or device is not directly proportional to frequency, or (b) the zero-frequency intercept of the phase-frequency characteristic is not 0 or an integral multiple of 2Ï€ radians.
