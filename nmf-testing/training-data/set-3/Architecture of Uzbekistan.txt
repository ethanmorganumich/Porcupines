Architecture of Uzbekistan
||||||
The architecture of Uzbekistan is noted for its originality. Many consider Uzbekistanâ€™s architecture to be notable despite the changing economic conditions, technological advances, demographic fluctuations, and cultural shifts that the country has experienced.
Notable architectural centers of Uzbekistan include Samarkand, Bukhara, Khiva, Shakhrisabz, Termez, and Kokand. Various ancient architectural masterpieces have also survived, including palaces, mausoleums, mosques, and minarets. Colorful mosaics, religious symbols, and abstract geometrical patterns also characterize architecture in Uzbekistan.
Archaeological research on Central Asia has revealed architectural trends running parallel to the Acheulean era. In fact, remains of monuments from both the Stone and Bronze Ages have been found in the Surkhandarya, Tashkent, Samarkand, Fergana, and Navoi regions of the country. During the Middle Ages, Uzbek architecture flourished as a result of being a central link in the 11,000-kilometre-long (7,000 mi) Silk Road. Timurid-period architecture from the 14th to 16th century, as well as the architecture of the Shaybanid era in the 16th century, contributed greatly to the development of Islamic architecture. In the 21st century, Uzbek architecture has been characterized by its balance of traditional design and modern innovation.
