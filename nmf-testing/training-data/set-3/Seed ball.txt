Seed ball
||||||
Seed balls, also known as earth balls or nendo dango (Japanese: 粘土団子),  consist of seeds rolled within a ball of clay and other matter to assist gemination. They are then thrown into vacant lots and over fences as a form of 'guerilla gardening'. Matter such as humus and compost are often placed around the seeds to provide microbial inoculants. Cotton-fibres or liquefied paper are sometimes added to further protect the clay ball in particularly harsh habitats. An ancient technique, it was re-discovered by Japanese natural farming pioneer Masanobu Fukuoka.
