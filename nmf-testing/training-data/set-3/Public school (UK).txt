Public school (United Kingdom)
||||||
In England and Wales (but not Scotland), a public school is a fee-charging endowed school originally for older boys. They are "public" in the sense of being open to pupils irrespective of locality, denomination or paternal trade or profession. In Scotland, a public school is synonymous with a state school in England and Wales, and fee-charging schools are referred to as private schools.
Although the term "public school" for fee-paying schools in England has been in use since at least the 18th century, its usage was formalised by the Public Schools Act 1868, which put into law most recommendations of the 1864 Clarendon Report. Nine prestigious schools were investigated by Clarendon (including Merchant Taylors' School and St. Paul's School) and seven subsequently reformed by the Act: Eton, Shrewsbury, Harrow, Winchester, Rugby, Westminster, and Charterhouse.Public schools are associated with the ruling classes. Historically, the sons of officers and senior administrators of the British Empire were educated in English public schools (most of them boarding) whilst their fathers were on imperial postings. In 2019, two-thirds of cabinet ministers of the United Kingdom had been educated at such fee-charging schools, in reversal of a trend as a slim majority of cabinet ministers since 1964 had been educated at state schools.
