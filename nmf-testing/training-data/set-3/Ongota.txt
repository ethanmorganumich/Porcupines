Ongota language
||||||
Ongota (also known as Birale, Birayle) is a moribund language of southwest Ethiopia. UNESCO reported in 2012 that out of a total ethnic population of 115, only 12 elderly native speakers remained, the rest of their small village on the west bank of the Weito River having adopted the Tsamai language instead.  The default word order is subject–object–verb. The classification of the language is obscure (Sava & Tosco 2015).
