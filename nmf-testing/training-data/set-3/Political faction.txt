Political faction
||||||
A political faction is a group of individuals that share a common political purpose but differs in some respect to the rest of the entity. A faction within a group or political party may include fragmented sub-factions, "parties within a party," which may be referred to as power blocs, or voting blocs. Members of factions band together as a way of achieving these goals and advancing their agenda and position within an organisation.
Faction acts as dissenters that emerge from one big organisation. In politics, these political factions may deflect into other political parties, that support their dissentive ideology and are more favourable towards them. This, for some countries may be considered unstable and fluctuating but counter-intuitively might help promote interests of diverse groups.
Factions are not limited to political parties; they can and frequently do form within any group that has some sort of political aim or purpose.
