Lapel
||||||
Lapels ( l…ô-PELZ) are the folded flaps of cloth on the front of a jacket or coat below the collar and are most commonly found on formal clothing and suit jackets. Usually they are formed by folding over the front edges of the jacket or coat and sewing them to the collar, an extra piece of fabric around the back of the neck.
There are three basic forms of lapels: notched, peaked, and shawl. Notched lapels, the most common, are usually seen on business suits, and on more casual jackets like blazers and sport coats. Peaked lapels are more formal, and nearly always used on double breasted jackets, but also frequently appear on single breasted ones. Shawl lapels are usually carried by tuxedos and mess jackets.
