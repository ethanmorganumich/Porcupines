Fabric structure
||||||
A fabric structure is a structure made of fabric, with or without a structural frame. The technology provides end users a variety of aesthetic free-form building designs. Custom-made structures are engineered and fabricated to meet worldwide structural, flame retardant, weather-resistant, and natural force requirements.
Fabric structures are considered a sub-category of tensile structure.
A fabric structure's material selection, design, engineering, fabrication, and installation are integral components to ensuring a sound structure.
