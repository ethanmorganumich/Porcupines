Beethoven's compositional method
||||||
Ludwig van Beethoven (1770â€“1827) was a German composer in the transition between the classical and romantic period. He composed in many different forms including nine symphonies, five piano concertos and a violin concerto. Beethoven's method of composition has long been debated among scholars. His sketches of composition drafts,  and his written letters,  provide contrasting evidence about his process of composition. However, many scholars agree that, for him,  composition was a slow and laborious process.  It is clear that his deafness impacted his compositional style, as evinced in certain changes in compositional method from early to late in his career.
