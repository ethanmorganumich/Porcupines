Muff (handwarmer)

A muff is a fashion accessory for outdoors usually made of a cylinder of fur or fabric with both ends open for keeping the hands warm. It was introduced to women's fashion in the 16th century and was popular with both men and women in the 17th and 18th centuries.  By the early 19th century, muffs were used in Europe only by women. It is also reported that the fashion largely fell out of style in the 19th century.
It briefly returned in the mid-1940s, and in the 1960s was developed as a motorcycle accessory for attachment as rider-protection and comfort during the cooler months.
