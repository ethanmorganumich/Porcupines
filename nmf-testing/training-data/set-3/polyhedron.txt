In geometry, a polyhedron (plural polyhedra or polyhedrons; from Greek  πολύ (poly-)  'many', and  εδρον (-hedron)  'base, seat') is a three-dimensional shape with flat polygonal faces, straight edges and sharp corners or vertices.
A convex polyhedron is the convex hull of finitely many points, not all on the same plane. Cubes and pyramids are examples of convex polyhedra.
A polyhedron is a 3-dimensional example of a polytope, a more general concept in any number of dimensions.
