||||||
The 2007 Georgia plane downing incident refers to the possible downing, by Georgia's anti-aircraft system, of a military plane that violated Georgia's air space on August 21, 2007. It is still not confirmed by Georgia whether the plane was downed. Abkhazia's break-away government stated that a plane crashed, and rejected the claim that it was shot down.
