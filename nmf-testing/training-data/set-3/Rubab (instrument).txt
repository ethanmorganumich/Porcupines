Rubab (instrument)
||||||
Rubab, robab or rabab (Pashto/Persian: رُباب, Kashmiri : رَبابہٕ, Sindhi: روباب (Nastaleeq), रबाब (Devanagari), Azerbaijani/Turkish: Rübab, Tajik/Uzbek рубоб) is a lute-like musical instrument. The rubab is one of the national musical instruments of Afghanistan; and is also commonly used in Pakistan in areas inhabited by the Pashtun and Baloch, and also played by Sindhi people in Sindh, by Kashmiri people in Kashmir, and by the Punjabis of the Punjab. Three variants of the rubab are the Kabuli rebab of Afghanistan, the Seni rebab of northern India, and the Pamiri rubab of Tajikistan. These proliferated throughout West, Central, South and Southeast Asia. The Kabuli rebab originates from Afghanistan, and it derives its name from Arabic rebab 'played with a bow'; in Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent, however, the instrument is plucked and is distinctly different in construction.
