Romanian architecture is diverse, including medieval, preWW1, interwar, postwar and contemporary 21st century architecture. In Romania, there are also regional differences with regard to architectural styles. Architecture, like the rest of the arts, was highly influenced by the socio-economic context and by the historical situation. For example, during the reign of king Carol I (1866-1914), Romania was in a continuous state of reorganization and modernization. In consequence, most of the architecture was designed by architects trained in Western European academies, particularly the Ã‰cole des Beaux-Arts, and a big part of the downtowns of the Romanian Old Kingdom were built during this period.
