Gomusin
||||||
Gomusin (Korean pronunciation: [komuɕʰin]) are shoes made of rubber in a form of Korean traditional shoes. The shoes are wide, with low heels. Gomusin for men were modeled after "gatsin" (갖신), and ones for women were danghye (당혜). Gomusin first appeared in the early 20th century. They were much easier to keep clean than danghye and jipsin (straw shoes) and they could be worn when it rains. Therefore, gomusin gained a popularity and replaced traditional shoes.
