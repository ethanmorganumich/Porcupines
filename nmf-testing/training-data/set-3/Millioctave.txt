Millioctave
||||||
The millioctave (moct) is a unit of measurement for musical intervals. As is expected from the prefix milli-, a millioctave is defined as 1/1000 of an octave. From this it follows that one millioctave is equal to the ratio 21/1000, the 1000th root of 2, or approximately 1.0006934 (play ).
Given two frequencies a and b, the measurement of the interval between them in millioctaves can be calculated by

  
    
      
        n
        =
        1000
        
          log
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            
              a
              b
            
          
          )
        
        ≈
        3322
        
          log
          
            10
          
        
        ⁡
        
          (
          
            
              a
              b
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle n=1000\log _{2}\left({\frac {a}{b}}\right)\approx 3322\log _{10}\left({\frac {a}{b}}\right)}
  Likewise, if you know a note b and the number n of millioctaves in the interval, then the other note a may be calculated by:

  
    
      
        a
        =
        b
        ×
        
          2
          
            
              n
              1000
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=b\times 2^{\frac {n}{1000}}}
  Like the more common cent, the millioctave is a linear measure of intervals, and thus the size of intervals can be calculated by adding their millioctave values, instead of multiplication, which is necessary for calculations of frequencies.
A millioctave is exactly 1.2 cents.
