Double whole note
||||||
In music, a double whole note (American), breve, or double note lasts two times as long as a whole note (or semibreve). It is the second-longest note value still in use in modern music notation. The longest notated note is the longa, which could be double or triple the length of a breve, although its use is most commonly found in early music. The longest notated note (though now obsolete) is the maxima.
