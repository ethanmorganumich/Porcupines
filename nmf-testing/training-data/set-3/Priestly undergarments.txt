Priestly undergarments

The priestly undergarments (Biblical Hebrew: מִכְנְסֵי־בָד, romanized: miḵnəsē-ḇāḏ) were "linen breeches" (KJV) worn by the priests and the High Priest in ancient Israel. They reached from the waist to the knees and so were not visible, being entirely hidden by the priestly tunic.
