Quintuple meter or quintuple time is a musical meter characterized by five beats in a measure.
They may consist of any combination of variably stressed or equally stressed beats.
Like the more common duple, triple, and quadruple meters, it may be simple, with each beat divided in half, or compound, with each beat divided into thirds. The most common time signatures for simple quintuple meter are 54 and 58, and compound quintuple meter is most often written in 158.
