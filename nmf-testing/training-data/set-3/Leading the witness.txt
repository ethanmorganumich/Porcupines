Leading question
||||||
In common law systems that rely on testimony by witnesses, a leading question is a question that suggests a particular answer and contains information the examiner is looking to have confirmed. The use of leading questions in court to elicit testimony is restricted in order to reduce the ability of the examiner to direct or influence the evidence presented.  Depending on the circumstances, leading questions can be objectionable or proper.The propriety of leading questions generally depends on the relationship of the witness to the party conducting the examination. An examiner may generally ask leading questions of a hostile witness or on cross-examination ("Will help to elicit the testimony of a witness who, due to age, incapacity, or limited intelligence, is having difficulty communicating her evidence"), but not on direct examination (to "coach" the witness to provide a particular answer).According to Black's Law Dictionary, a leading question is defined as "question that suggests the answer to the person being interrogated; esp., a question that may be answered by a mere ‘yes’ or ‘no."
