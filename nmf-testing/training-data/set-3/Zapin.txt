Zapin
||||||
Zapin (Jawi: زافين) is one of the most popular dance and musical forms in traditional Malay performing arts. Dance movements are choreographed to melodies which are performed using musical instruments such as the gambus (short-necked lute), accordion and rebana.
It is believed to have been introduced by Persian and Arab Muslim missionaries from the Middle East to Malay Archipelago around the fourteenth century where back then only males were allowed to perform; nowadays, female dancers are included. It used to be performed exclusively for religious ceremonies but through the years it has become a form of traditional entertainment, hence the participation of female dancers is allowed.
