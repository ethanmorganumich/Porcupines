Wave propagation

Wave propagation is any of the ways in which waves travel. Single wave propagation can be calculated by 2nd order wave equation (standing wavefield) or 1st order one-way wave equation.
With respect to the direction of the oscillation relative to the propagation direction, we can distinguish between longitudinal wave and transverse waves.
For electromagnetic waves, propagation may occur in a vacuum as well as in the material medium. Other wave types cannot propagate through a vacuum and need a transmission medium to exist.
