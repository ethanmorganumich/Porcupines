Shot (filmmaking)

In filmmaking and video production, a shot is a series of frames that runs for an uninterrupted period of time.  Film shots are an essential aspect of a movie where angles, transitions and cuts are used to further express emotion, ideas and movement.  The term "shot" can refer to two different parts of the filmmaking process:

In production, a shot is the moment that the camera starts rolling until the moment it stops.
In film editing, a shot is the continuous footage or sequence between two edits or cuts.
