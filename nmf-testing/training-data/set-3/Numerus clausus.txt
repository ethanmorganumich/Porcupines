Numerus clausus
||||||
Numerus clausus ("closed number" in Latin) is one of many methods used to limit the number of students who may study at a university. In many cases, the goal of the numerus clausus is simply to limit the number of students to the maximum feasible in some particularly sought-after areas of studies with an intent to keep a constant supply of qualified workforce and thus limit competition.  In historical terms however, in some countries, numerus clausus policies were religious or racial quotas, both in intent and function.
