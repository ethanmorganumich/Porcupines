Biodanza
||||||
Biodanza (a neologism jointed the Greek bio [life] and the Spanish danza, literally "the dance of life") is a system of self-development utilizing music, movement and positive feelings to deepen self-awareness. It seeks to promote the ability to make a holistic link to oneself and one's emotions and to express them. Practitioners believe that Biodanza opens the space for one to deepen the bonds with others and nature and to express those feelings in a congenial manner.
