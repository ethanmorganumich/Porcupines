Krama
||||||
A krama (; Khmer: ក្រមា  [krɑːmaː]) is a sturdy traditional Cambodian garment with many uses, including as a scarf, bandanna, to cover the face, for decorative purposes, and as a hammock for children. It may also be used as a form of weaponry. Bokator fighters wrap the krama around their waists, heads and fists. It is worn by men, women and children, and can be fairly ornate, though most typical kramas contain a gingham pattern of some sort, and traditionally come in either red or blue. It is the Cambodian national symbol.
A closely related Thai garment is known as pha khao ma (ผ้าขาวม้า) and is worn in the Isan region by locals and by ethnic Khmers.
