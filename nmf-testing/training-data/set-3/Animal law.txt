Animal law
||||||
Animal law is a combination of statutory and case law in which the nature –  legal, social or biological –  of nonhuman animals is an important factor. Animal law encompasses companion animals, wildlife, animals used in entertainment and animals raised for food and research. The emerging field of animal law is often analogized to the environmental law movement because "animal law faces many of the same legal and strategic challenges that environmental law faced in seeking to establish a more secure foothold in the United States and abroad".Animal law issues encompass a broad spectrum of approaches –  from philosophical explorations of the rights of animals to pragmatic discussions about the rights of those who use animals, who has standing to sue when an animal is harmed in a way that violates the law, and what constitutes legal cruelty. Animal law permeates and affects most traditional areas of the law –  including tort, contract, criminal and constitutional law. Examples of this intersection include:

animal custody disputes in divorce or separations
veterinary malpractice cases
housing disputes involving "no pets" policies and discrimination laws
damages cases involving the wrongful death or injury to a companion animal
enforceable trusts for companions being adopted by states across the country
criminal law –  anti-cruelty laws.
