Text declamation
||||||
Text declamation refers to the manner in which a composer sets words to music.  Aesthetically, declamation is conceived of as "accurate" (approximating the natural rhythms and patterns of human speech) or not, which informs perceptions about emotional power as expressed through the relationship between words and music.
