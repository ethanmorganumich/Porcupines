The Batsuit (or Bat-Suit) is the costume of DC Comics' fictional superhero Batman, who appears in their American comic books. The suit has been depicted in various ways, and the stories themselves have described Batman as modifying the details of his costume from time to time. However, it usually consists of a gray or black body suit, the chest emblazoned with a stylized black bat either with or without a yellow ellipse around it, and blue-black accessories: a wide scalloped cape, gloves with a series of fin-like projections, black trunks, boots, and a close-fitting cowl (covering the upper half of his face) with ear-like projections to suggest a bat's head; and a yellow or gold utility belt containing a variety of gadgets.
