Šubara
||||||
The šubara (Serbian Cyrillic: шубара) is a type of traditional male winter hat used by the Serbs in folk attire. It is in a conical or cylindrical shape predominantly in black colour, because of the black lamb/sheep fur (woollen). It is a traditional peasant hat used in harsher and colder times.
It was used in the World War I by the Serbian soldiers and by the Chetniks in World War II and again during the Yugoslav Wars. It usually has the cockade (kokarda) of the Serbian eagle or other Serbian symbols.
