Industrial design right
||||||
An industrial design right is an intellectual property right that protects the visual design of objects that are purely utilitarian.  An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value.  An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft.
Under the Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs, a WIPO-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. To qualify for registration, the national laws of most member states of WIPO require the design to be novel. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.  Design rights started in the United Kingdom in 1787 with the Designing and Printing of Linen Act and have expanded from there.
Registering for an industrial design right is related to granting a patent.
