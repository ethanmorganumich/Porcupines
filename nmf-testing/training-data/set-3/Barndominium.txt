The fifth and final season premiered on November 21, 2017.Fixer Upper became popular soon after its debut, and the series is largely credited with the rise in popularity of "Farmhouse-chic" interior design in the late 2010s. In 2018, Zillow reported that homes with architectural features mentioned on the show, such as wainscoting, shiplap, clawfoot bathtubs, and barn doors, sold at an average of 30 percent above expected value. In addition, the show has generated an increase in tourism and economic development in Waco, Texas, where the show was taped.In 2020, Discovery Inc. announced that Fixer Upper would be revived as a launch program for Magnolia Networkâ€”a new channel overseen by the Gaines that replaced HGTV's sister channel DIY Network.
