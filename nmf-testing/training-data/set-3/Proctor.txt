Proctor (a variant of procurator) is a person who takes charge of, or acts for, another.The title is used in England and some other English-speaking countries in three principal contexts:
In law, a proctor is a historical class of lawyers, and the King's (or Queen's) Proctor is a senior government lawyer.
In religion, a proctor represents the clergy in Church of England dioceses.
In education, proctor is the name of university officials in certain universities.In the United States and some other countries, the word "proctor" is frequently used to describe someone who supervises an examination (i.e. a supervisor or invigilator) or dormitory.
