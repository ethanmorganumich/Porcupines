Biblical sandals (Hebrew: סנדלים תנ"כיים, sandalim tanakhim), also called Tanakhi sandals and Khugistic sandals (Hebrew: סנדלים חוגיסטיים, sandalim ḥugistim), are sandals consisting of a sole with two leather straps that pass across the top of the foot, and one around the heel. The leather is usually brown or black. The term is widely used by manufacturers in Israel.
