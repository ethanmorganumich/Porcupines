Allocation questionnaire
||||||
An allocation questionnaire is a form used in English legal practice.  After a claim is made, if a defence is filed each party is required to complete and return an allocation questionnaire to the court so that the judge may properly allocate the claim to a track and give further directions towards a final hearing.
