The priestly robe (Hebrew: מְעִיל me'il), sometimes robe of the ephod (מְעִיל הָאֵפֹוד‎ meil ha-ephod), is one of the sacred articles of clothing (bigdei kehunah) of the Jewish High Priest. The robe is described in Exodus 28:31–35. It was worn under the Ephod. Like all the priestly garments, it was to be made by 'gifted artisans ... filled with the spirit of wisdom'.
