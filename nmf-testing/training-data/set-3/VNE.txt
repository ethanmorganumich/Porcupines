V speeds

In aviation, V-speeds are standard terms used to define airspeeds important or useful to the operation of all aircraft. These speeds are derived from data obtained by aircraft designers and manufacturers during flight testing for aircraft type-certification. Using them is considered a best practice to maximize aviation safety, aircraft performance, or both.The actual speeds represented by these designators are specific to a particular model of aircraft. They are expressed by the aircraft's indicated airspeed (and not by, for example, the ground speed), so that pilots may use them directly, without having to apply correction factors, as aircraft instruments also show indicated airspeed.
In general aviation aircraft, the most commonly used and most safety-critical airspeeds are displayed as color-coded arcs and lines located on the face of an aircraft's airspeed indicator.  The lower ends of the white arc and the green arc are the stalling speed with wing flaps fully extended, and stalling speed with wing flaps retracted, respectively.  These are the stalling speeds for the aircraft at its maximum weight.  The yellow band is the range in which the aircraft may be operated in smooth air, and then only with caution to avoid abrupt control movement.  The red line is the VNE, the never-exceed speed.
Proper display of V-speeds is an airworthiness requirement for type-certificated aircraft in most countries.
