Beauchamp-Feuillet notation
||||||
Beauchamp–Feuillet notation is a system of dance notation used in Baroque dance.

The notation was commissioned by Louis XIV (who had founded the Académie Royale de Danse in 1661), and devised in the 1680s by Pierre Beauchamp.  The notation system was first described in detail in 1700 by Raoul-Auger Feuillet in Chorégraphie.  Feuillet also then began a programme of publishing complete notated dances.  It was used to record dances for the stage and domestic use throughout the eighteenth century, being modified by Pierre Rameau in 1725, and surviving into at least the 1780s in various modified forms.
One of the innovations of this notation, as you can see in the sample below, was to show the music, on a staff as a musician would use it, across the top of a page. The roles of the dancer or dancers, the tract they were to follow, and the steps to perform are shown in the notation below. The bar markings on the music are also drawn across the tract of the dancers, clarifying the relation of the steps to the music. The focus of the notation is the footwork
