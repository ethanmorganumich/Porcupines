A faluche is a traditional cap worn by students in France. It is a black velvet beret, decorated with colored ribbons and badges.
Several student groups wear the faluche, especially bitards, basochards, and faluchards. Previously, the faluche was associated almost exclusively with faluchards, although other folklore exists concerning the faluche.
