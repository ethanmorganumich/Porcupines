Altay is a Turkish modern main battle tank based on South Korean K2 Black Panther to be produced by BMC under design assistance and technology transfer by Hyundai Rotem. It is named in honor of Army General Fahrettin Altay who commanded the 5th Cavalry Corps in the final stage of the Turkish War of Independence. It is one of the most expensive tank designs with a unit cost of 13.75 million dollars. The first mass production of Altay will be combined with MKE made 55 calibre 120 mm main gun, Roketsan made advanced armor package along with Aselsan made active protection system, and Hyundai Doosan Infracore engine and SNT Dynamics transmission.
