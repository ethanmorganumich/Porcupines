Seven generation sustainability
||||||
Seven generation stewardship is a concept that urges the current generation of humans to live and work for the benefit of the seventh generation into the future.
It is believed to have originated with the Iroquois – Great Law of the Iroquois – which holds appropriate to think seven generations ahead and decide whether the decisions they make today would benefit their descendants.  It is frequently associated with the modern, popular concept of environmental stewardship or 'sustainability' but it is much broader in context.
