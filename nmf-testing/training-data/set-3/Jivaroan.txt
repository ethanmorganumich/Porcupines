Jivaroan peoples
||||||
The Jivaroan peoples are the indigenous peoples in the headwaters of the Mara√±on River and its tributaries, in northern Peru and eastern Ecuador. The tribes speak the Chicham languages.Their traditional way of life relies on gardening, and on hunting with blowguns and darts poisoned with curare. Complex spiritual beliefs are built around both of these activities. Jivaroan culture also features headhunting raids and ayahuasca ceremonies.
In the 16th century, Jivaroan warriors stopped the expansion of the Inca Empire into the Amazon basin, and destroyed settlements of Spanish conquistadors.
