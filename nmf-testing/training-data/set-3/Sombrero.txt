A sombrero (Spanish transl. hat, lit. 'shadower') is a type of wide-brimmed Mexican men's hat used to shield the face and eyes from the sun. It usually has a high pointed crown, an extra-wide brim (broad enough to cast a shadow over the head, neck and shoulders of the wearer) that is slightly upturned at the edge, and a chin strap to hold it in place.  
In Mexico, this hat type is known as a sombrero de charro ("charro hat", referring to the traditional Mexican horsemen).
In Spanish, any wide-brimmed hat may be considered a sombrero.
