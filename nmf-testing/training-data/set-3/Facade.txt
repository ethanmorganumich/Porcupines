Façade
||||||
A façade ( (listen)) (also written facade) is generally the front part or exterior of a building. It is a loan word from the French façade (pronounced [fasad]), which means 'frontage' or 'face'.
In architecture, the façade of a building is often the most important aspect from a design standpoint, as it sets the tone for the rest of the building. From the engineering perspective, the façade is also of great importance due to its impact on energy efficiency. For historical façades, many local zoning regulations or other laws greatly restrict or even forbid their alteration.
