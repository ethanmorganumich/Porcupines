Pajamas (US) or pyjamas (Commonwealth) (), sometimes colloquially shortened to PJs, jammies, jam-jams, or in South Asia night suits, are several related types of clothing worn as nightwear or while lounging or performing remote work from home. Pajamas are soft and loose garments derived from the Indian and Persian bottom-wear, the pyjamas. They originated in the Indian subcontinent and were adopted in the Western world as nightwear.
