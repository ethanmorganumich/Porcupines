Fagging
||||||
Fagging  was a traditional practice in British public schools and also at many other boarding schools, whereby younger pupils were required to act as personal servants to the eldest boys. Although probably originating earlier, the first accounts of fagging appeared in the late 17th century.: 23  
Fagging sometimes involved physical abuse: 23–25  and/or sexual abuse. Although lessening in severity over the centuries, the practice continued in some institutions until the end of the 20th century.: 23–25
