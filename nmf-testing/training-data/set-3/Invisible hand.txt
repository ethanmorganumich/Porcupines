Invisible hand

The invisible hand is a metaphor used by the British moral philosopher Adam Smith for his theorized social mechanism according to which within the free markets the domestic bourgeoisie invest in their home country, even if it is not the most profitable, guided by the "invisible hand" that drives the public interest. In The Wealth of Nations Smith talks about the invisible hand in connection with import restrictions.
Smith was worried that if the movement of capital and the movement of goods (imports) were both free, the British bourgeoisie would invest abroad, to the detriment of Britain. To this, Smith came up with an argument according to which the British bourgeois would be biased according to their place of residence and would therefore make investments in the home country guided by an "invisible hand". Smith originally mentioned the term in his work Theory of Moral Sentiments in 1759, but it has actually become known from his main work The Wealth of Nations, where the word itself is mentioned only once.
Later, the concept has been captured to mean that the pursuit of individual interest leads to the general good. Before the enlightenment era, pursuing one's own interest was considered against the common good. According to Adam Smith, "it is the pursuit of individual self-interest that enables society based on the division of labor to function". In addition, Smith presented that people's efforts to promote their own economic interests in the best possible way have positive consequences for society as a whole. Similar ideas had already been presented before Smith by other Enlightenment thinkers, such as Anders Chydenius in his work The National Gain (1765) and Bernard Mandeville. Liberal thinkers wanted to show that society functions without collapsing even without the old hierarchical order of the feudal era.
 The concept was first introduced by Adam Smith in The Theory of Moral Sentiments, written in 1759. The exact phrase is used just three times in Smith's writings.
Smith may have come up with the two meanings of the phrase from Richard Cantillon who developed both economic applications in his model of the isolated estate.The idea of trade and market exchange automatically channeling self-interest toward socially desirable ends is a central justification for the laissez-faire economic philosophy, which lies behind neoclassical economics. In this sense, the central disagreement between economic ideologies can be viewed as a disagreement about how powerful the "invisible hand" is. In alternative models, forces that were nascent during Smith's lifetime, such as large-scale industry, finance, and advertising, reduce its effectiveness.Interpretations of the term have been generalized beyond the usage by Smith and some academic sources claim that the modern understanding of the concept was invented much more recently by Paul Samuelson to back up spontaneous order.
