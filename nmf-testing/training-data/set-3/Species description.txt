Species description
||||||
A species description is a formal description of a newly discovered species, usually in the form of a scientific paper.  Its purpose is to give a clear description of a new species of organism and explain how it differs from species that have been described previously or are related. The species description often contains photographs or other illustrations of the type material and states in which museums it has been deposited. The publication in which the species is described gives the new species a formal scientific name. Some 1.9 million species have been identified and described, out of some 8.7 million that may actually exist. Millions more have become extinct throughout the existence of life on Earth.
