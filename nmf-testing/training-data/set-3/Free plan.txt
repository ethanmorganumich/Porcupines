Free plan
||||||
In architecture, a free plan is an open plan with non-load-bearing walls dividing interior space. In this structural system, the building structure is separate of the interior partitions. This is made possible by replacing interior load-bearing walls with moving the structure of the building to the exterior, or by having columns that are free from space dividing partitions.
