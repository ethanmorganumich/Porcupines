Herodian architecture
||||||
Herodian architecture is a style of classical architecture characteristic of the numerous building projects undertaken during the reign (37â€“4 BC) of Herod the Great, the Roman client king of Judea. Herod undertook many colossal building projects, most famously his reconstruction of the Temple in Jerusalem (c. 19 BC). Many of his structures were built upon comparable, previous Hasmonean buildings and most of his have, in their turn, vanished as well.
