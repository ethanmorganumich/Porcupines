Property rights (economics)
||||||
Property rights are constructs in economics for determining how a resource or economic good is used and owned, which have developed over ancient and modern history, from Abrahamic law to Article 17 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Resources can be owned by (and hence be the property of) individuals, associations, collectives, or governments.Property rights can be viewed as an attribute of an economic good. This attribute has three broad components, and is often referred to as a bundle of rights in the United States:
the right to use the good
the right to earn income from the good
the right to transfer the good to others, alter it, abandon it, or destroy it (the right to ownership cessation)
