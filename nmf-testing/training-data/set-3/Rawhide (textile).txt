Rawhide (material)
||||||
Rawhide is a hide or animal skin that has not been exposed to tanning. It is similar to parchment, much lighter in color than leather made by traditional vegetable tanning.
Rawhide is more susceptible to water than leather, and it quickly softens and stretches if left wet unless well waterproofed.
"Rawhide" laces often sold for boots or baseball gloves are made of normal tanned leather rather than actual rawhide. Rawhide is not pliable when dry and would be unsuitable for that use.
