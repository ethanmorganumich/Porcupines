Pornography

Pornography (often shortened to porn or porno) is the portrayal of sexual subject matter for the exclusive purpose of sexual arousal. Primarily intended for adults, pornography is presented in a variety of media, including magazines, art, literature, photography, audio, film, animation, and video games. A distinction is often made as to whether to classify adult content as pornography or erotica.Throughout the history of erotic depictions, various groups within society have considered them to be noxious, and made attempts to have them suppressed under obscenity laws, censored, or made illegal. Such grounds—and even the definition of pornography—have differed in various historical, cultural, and national contexts. In the late 19th century, a film by Thomas Edison which depicted a kiss was denounced as obscene in the United States, while Eugene Pirou's 1896 film Bedtime for the Bride was received very favorably in France. Starting from the mid-twentieth century, societal attitudes towards sexuality have become more lenient in the Western world, and legal definitions of obscenity made limited. In 1969, Blue Movie by Andy Warhol became the first film to depict unsimulated sex and receive a wide theatrical release in the United States. This was followed by the Golden Age of Porn (1969–1984), a time period when many high quality pornographic films played in theaters and became part of popular culture.
The introduction of home video and the Internet in the late 20th century led to worldwide growth in the pornography business, generating billions of dollars annually.

In 2001, Commercialized pornography in the United States accounted for over US$2.5 billion, this included the costs for production of various media, and associated products and services. In 2006, the worldwide revenue from pornography was estimated at 97 billion dollars, with the U.S. estimates at around $10–$12 billion. In 2018, Pornography in Japan was estimated to be worth over $20 billion.The industry in the U.S. employs thousands of performers along with production and support staff. It has its own industry publication, AVN; a trade association, the Free Speech Coalition; and an award show, the AVN Awards. Apart from coverage from mainstream press, the industry also receives considerable attention from private organizations, government agencies, and political organizations. In 2020s, issues of popular pornographic sites hosting content by unscrupulous uploaders, and cybersex trafficking have been reported.
