Hall and parlor house
||||||
A hall-and-parlor house is a type of vernacular house found in early-modern to 19th century England, as well as in colonial North America. It is presumed to have been the model on which other North American house types have been developed, such as the Cape Cod house, saltbox, and central-passage house, and in turn influenced the somewhat-later I-house. In England it had been a more modest development from the medieval hall house.
