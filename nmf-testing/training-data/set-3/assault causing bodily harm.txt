Assault causing bodily harm
||||||
Assault causing bodily harm is a statutory offence of assault in Canada with aggravating factors. It is committed by anyone who, in committing an assault, causes bodily harm to the complainant. It is the Canadian equivalent to the statutory offence in England and Wales of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  In Canada, a consensual fight is not considered an assault, but one cannot consent to an assault causing bodily harm.
