Voice classification in non-classical music
||||||
There is no authoritative system of voice classification in non-classical music as classical terms are used to describe not merely various vocal ranges, but specific vocal timbres unique to each range. These timbres are produced by  classical training techniques with which most popular singers are not intimately familiar, and which even those that are do not universally employ them.
