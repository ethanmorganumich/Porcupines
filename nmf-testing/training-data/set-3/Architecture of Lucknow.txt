Architecture of Lucknow
||||||
The Lucknow School of Architecture was an experiment by the resurgent Nawabs of Awadh. It was an attempt to preserve the Mughal school of architecture by experimenting with different materials and innovating new concepts.
Among the extant architecture there are religious buildings such as imambaras, mosques and other Islamic shrines,  and secular structures like enclosed gardens, baradaris, palace complexes.
The following are distinct features of Lucknow architecture :

Use of Fish as an auspicious and decorative motif especially on Gates
The use of Chattar ( umbrella ) as in the Chattar Manzil
The Baradari ( the twelve doorway pavilions)
Rumi Darwaza, the signature structure of Lucknow
Enclosed Baghs like Sikandar Bagh
Vaulted halls such as the Asafi Imambara
The labyrinth Bhulbhulaiyan
Taikhanas
Use of lakhauri bricks.Lucknow’s geography also plays a major role in determining the type of structures built. Lucknow is based on fertile land, and the land below the Himalayan foothills is known as 'Terai' or moist land. It is located in the middle of Ganaetic Plain and reaches Gomati (left of Ganga River), placing it in the center of Uttar Pradesh.The monuments in Lucknow have been influenced by various cultures and religions throughout the years. Dating back to the 18th century, Lucknow also named "Awadh", or "Oudh" was one of the richest semi-independent states under the Mughal rule and was predominantly ruled by Muslim Shiites of Persian origin known as “Nawabs”. Being defeated by the British Imperials forces, the nawabs made an alliance with the East India Company until it was annexed in 1856. It is for this reason that you will see various influences from Persia, Turkey, and Europe (such as France).
