American Youth Congress
||||||
The American Youth Congress (AYC) was an early youth voice organization composed of youth from all across the country to discuss the problems facing youth as a whole in the 1930s.  It met several years in a row - one year it notably met on the lawn of the White House. The delegates are known to have caused a disturbance when they attempted to access the United States Congress.  They focused on the draft, which was taking youths at age 18 off to war.  At the time in the United States one was not legally an adult in any way until the age of 21. They also focused on the economic exploitation of youth.
The formation of the AYC is also widely seen as a precursor to the establishment of the National Youth Administration. Both the AYC and the NYA are notable for the support which First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt lent to them.
