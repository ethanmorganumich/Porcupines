Sustainable fashion
||||||
Sustainable fashion (also known as eco-fashion) is a term describing products, processes, activities, and actors (policymakers, brands, consumers) aiming to achieve a carbon-neutral fashion industry, built on equality, social justice, animal welfare, and ecological integrity. Sustainable fashion concerns more than addressing fashion textiles or products. It addresses the entire process in which clothing is produced, consumed and disposed; who, what, how, when, where and the expected useful life of the product before entering landfill. The sustainable movement looks to combat the large carbon footprint that fast fashion has created by reducing the environmental impact of fashion such as air pollution, water pollution and overall climate change.
In 2020, it was found that an approach of voluntary self-directed reform of textile manufacturing supply chains to reduce the environmental impact of fashion by large companies had failed. Measures to reform fashion beyond greenwashing needed to involve policies for the creation and enforcement of standardized certificates along with related import controls, subsidies and eco-tariff-like interventions.
