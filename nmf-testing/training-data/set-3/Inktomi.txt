Inktomi Corporation was a company that provided software for Internet service providers (ISPs). It was incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Foster City, California, United States. Customers included Microsoft, HotBot, Amazon.com, eBay, and Walmart.The company developed Traffic Server, a proxy server web cache for World Wide Web traffic and on-demand streaming media which transcoded images down to a smaller size for users of dial-up Internet access. Traffic Server was deployed by several large ISPs including AOL.In 2003, after the bursting of the dot-com bubble, the company was acquired by Yahoo! for $241 million.
The company's name, pronounced "INK-tuh-me", was derived from a legend of the Lakota people about a trickster spider character, Iktomi, which was known for his ability to defeat larger adversaries through wit and cunning. The tri-color nested cube logo was created by Tom Lamar in 1996.
