Public defender
||||||
A public defender is a lawyer appointed to represent people who otherwise cannot reasonably afford to hire a lawyer to defend themselves in a trial. Several countries provide people with public defenders, including the UK, Hungary and Singapore, and some states of Australia. Brazil is the only country in which an office of government-paid lawyers with the specific purpose of providing full legal assistance and representation to the needy free of charge is established in the constitution. The Sixth Amendment of the US Constitution has been interpreted to require the US government to provide free legal counsel to indigent defendants in criminal cases, and public defenders in the United States are lawyers employed by or under contract with county, state or federal governments.
