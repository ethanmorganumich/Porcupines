Global Environment and Trade Study
||||||
The Global Environment & Trade Study (GETS) was a non-profit research institute established in 1994 to study the complex linkages between international trade and environmental sustainability.  GETS supported numerous research projects on the legal, economic, and ecological aspects of trade and environment.
GETS was centered at Yale University.GETS also studied the expanding role of civil society in global governance.
In 2004, the GETS Board decided that a sufficient amount had been accomplished over the decade, and that it was time to terminate the project.
