The  Wienerlied (German, literally: Viennese song, pl. Wienerlieder) or Weanaliad (viennese, pl. Weanaliada) is a song genre which has its roots in Vienna, the capital of Austria. Traditional Viennese songs, known as Wienerlieder are centred on the theme of life in Vienna and are almost exclusively sung in Viennese (a local Austro-Bavarian dialect). The Wienerlied is a unique musical and socio-cultural phenomenon, a psychograph of the Viennese way of life; a mix between idealism, joie de vivre and desperation.There are approximately 60,000 â€“ 70,000 Wienerlieder, of which only a few hundred are still sung today.
