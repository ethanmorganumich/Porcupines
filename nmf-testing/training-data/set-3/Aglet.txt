Aglet
||||||
An aglet ( AG-l…ôt) or aiglet is a small sheath, often made of plastic or metal, attached at each end of a shoelace, a cord, or a drawstring. An aglet keeps the fibers of the lace or cord from unraveling; its firmness and narrow profile make it easier to hold and easier to feed through  eyelets, lugs, or other lacing guides.
