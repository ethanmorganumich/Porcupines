Loophole (firearm)
||||||
A loophole is a protected small opening, which allows a firearm to be aimed and discharged, while providing cover and concealment for the rifleman.  To prevent detection, the rifle's muzzle should not protrude through the loophole, particularly at night to hide the muzzle flash.
