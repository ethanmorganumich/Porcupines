Stalinist architecture
||||||
Stalinist architecture, mostly known in the former Eastern Bloc as Stalinist style (Russian: Сталинский стиль, romanized: Stalinskiy stil′) or Socialist Classicism, is the architecture of the Soviet Union under the leadership of Joseph Stalin, between 1933 (when Boris Iofan's draft for the Palace of the Soviets was officially approved) and 1955 (when Nikita Khrushchev condemned "excesses" of the past decades and disbanded the Soviet Academy of Architecture). Stalinist architecture is associated with the Socialist realism school of art and architecture.
