Type 07 (Chinese: “零七”式军服，“07”式军服) is a group of military uniforms used by all branches of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the paramilitary Chinese People's Armed Police Force. Introduced in 2007, the Type 07 uniforms replaced the Type 87 service uniforms used by regular units and the Type 97 Service Dress uniforms of the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison and the People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison. The Type 07 uniforms were first seen in late June 2007 during a celebration ceremony for the 10th anniversary of the Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong.The design of the Type 07 uniform, especially that of the dress uniform, borrowed from older designs. The older designs, in turn, were influenced by those of the Soviet Union. The Type 07 design has striped cuff insignia which indicate years of service. The stripe cuff insignia are worn by all commissioned officers except for naval admirals and officers who use sleeve insignia on their dress blues.
The combat uniforms are slated to be replaced by newer Type 19 uniform with the Xingkong camouflage pattern.
