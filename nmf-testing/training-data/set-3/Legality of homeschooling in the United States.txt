Homeschooling in the United States
||||||
Homeschooling in the United States of America constitutes the education of about 3.4% of U.S. students (approximately 2 million students) as of 2012. The number of homeschoolers in the United States has increased steadily over the past few decades since the end of the 20th century. In the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled that parents have a fundamental right to direct the education of their children. The right to homeschool is not frequently questioned in court, but the amount of state regulation and help that can or should be expected continues to be subject to legal debate.
United States Supreme Court precedent appears to favor educational choice, as long as states set standards.
