Trace evidence

Trace evidence is created when objects make contact. The material is often transferred by heat or induced by contact friction.
The importance of trace evidence in criminal investigations was shown by Dr. Edmond Locard in the early 20th century. Since then, forensic scientists use trace evidence to reconstruct crimes and to describe the people, places, and things involved in them. Studies of homicides published in the forensic science literature show how trace evidence is used to solve crimes. Trace evidence is important in accident investigation, where the movement of one part against another will often leave a tell-tale mark. Such analysis is of great use in forensic engineering.
