Architectural mythology
||||||
Architectural mythology means the symbolism of real-world architecture, as well as architecture described in mythological stories. In addition to language, a myth could be represented by a painting, a sculpture or a building. It is about the overall story of an architectural work, often revealed through art.  
Not all stories surrounding an architectural work incorporate a level of myth. These stories can also be well hidden to the casual viewer and are often built into the conceptual design of the architectural statement.

The value of a built environment, therefore, is a conglomerate of its actual physical existence and the historical memories and myths people attach to it, bring to it, and project on it.
