Generation Yes was an astroturf group in Ireland that was active in promoting the country's European Union (EU) membership and a 'Yes' vote in the campaign prior to the second referendum on the country's ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon, which was held on 2 October 2009.The group was launched 24 April 2009, was primarily made up of college students and graduates. Generation Yes had a stated aim to use social networking websites (such as Facebook and Twitter) to organise a "grassroots movement".Despite is claims to promote Ireland in Europe the fact that it didn't do anything after the second lisbon treaty referendum, and that the website was not renewed indicates it was just a referendum campaign channel and not an organic pro-eu advocacy group.
