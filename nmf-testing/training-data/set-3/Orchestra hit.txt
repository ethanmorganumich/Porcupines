Orchestra hit
||||||
An orchestra hit, also known as an orchestral hit, orchestra stab, or orchestral stab, is a synthesized sound created through the layering of the sounds of a number of different orchestral instruments playing a single staccato note or chord. The orchestra hit sound was propagated by the use of early samplers, particularly the Fairlight CMI where it was known as the ORCH5 sample.  The sound is used in pop, hip hop, jazz fusion, techno, and video game genres to accentuate passages of music.The orchestra hit has been identified as a "hip hop clich√©". In 1990, Musician magazine stated that Fairlight's ORCH5 sample was "the orchestral hit that was heard on every rap and techno-pop record of the early 1980s".  The orchestra hit has been described as popular music's equivalent to the Wilhelm scream, a sound effect widely used in film.
