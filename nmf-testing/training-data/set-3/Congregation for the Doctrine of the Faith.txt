Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith
||||||
The Dicastery for the Doctrine of the Faith (DDF) is the oldest among the departments of the Roman Curia. Its seat is the Palace of the Holy Office in Rome. It was founded to defend the Catholic Church from heresy; today, it is the body responsible for promulgating and defending Catholic doctrine. It was formerly called the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Roman and Universal Inquisition; between 1908 and 1965 the Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office; and then until June 2022 the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF; Latin: Congregatio pro Doctrina Fidei). It is still informally known as the Holy Office (Latin: Sanctum Officium).
Founded by Pope Paul III in 1542, the congregation's sole objective is to "spread sound Catholic doctrine and defend those points of Christian tradition which seem in danger because of new and unacceptable doctrines." Its headquarters are at the Palace of the Holy Office, just outside Vatican City. The congregation employs an advisory board including cardinals, bishops, priests, lay theologians, and canon lawyers. The current Prefect is Cardinal Luis Ladaria Ferrer, who was appointed by Pope Francis for a five-year term beginning July 2017.
