Sweater design
||||||
Sweater design is a specialization of fashion design in which knitted sweaters are designed to fulfill certain aesthetic, functional and commercial criteria.  The designer typically considers factors such as the insulating power of the sweater (and its resulting warmth for the wearer); the fashion of its colors, patterns, silhouette and style lines, particularly the neckline and waistline; the convenience and practicality of its cut; and in commercial design, the cost of its production and the profitability of its price point.  Sweater designs are often published in books and knitting magazines.  Sweater design is an old art, but continues to attract new designers such as Nicky Epstein and Meg Swansen.
