The Honda CR-X (styled in some markets as Honda CRX), originally launched as the Honda Ballade Sports CR-X in Japan, is a front-wheel-drive sport compact car manufactured by Honda from 1983 until 1991.  The first generation CRX was marketed in some regions outside Japan as the Honda Civic CRX.  Although there are many supposed definitions for the acronym CR-X, the most widely accepted is "Civic Renaissance Experimental".In the U.S., the CRX was marketed as an economy sport Kammback with room for two passengers while Japanese and European market cars came with a 2+2 seating arrangement.  Redesigned for the 1988 model year and produced until 1991, the CRX was popular for its performance, nimble handling, and good fuel economy. The CR-X was replaced by Honda's CR-X del Sol and was marketed as a CR-X in some markets.
