Joint wills and mutual wills
||||||
Joint wills and mutual wills are closely related terms used in the law of wills to describe two types of testamentary writing that may be executed by a married couple to ensure that their property is disposed of identically.  Neither should be confused with mirror wills which means two separate, identical wills, which may or may not also be mutual wills.
