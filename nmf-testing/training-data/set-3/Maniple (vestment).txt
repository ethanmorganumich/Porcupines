Maniple (vestment)
||||||
The maniple is a liturgical vestment used primarily within the Catholic Church, and occasionally used by some Anglo-Catholic and Lutheran clergy. It is an embroidered band of silk or similar fabric that is hung over the left arm. It is only used within the context of the Mass, and it is of the same liturgical colour as the other Mass vestments.The purpose of the maniple is uncertain, but it probably originated as a cloth the priest could use to wipe his hands and face.
