Lombard architecture
||||||
Lombard architecture refers to the architecture of the Kingdom of the Lombards, which lasted from 568 to 774 (with residual permanence in southern Italy until the 10th–11th centuries) and which was commissioned by Lombard kings and dukes.
The architectural works of the Lombards in northern Italy (Langobardia Major) have been mostly lost due to later renovations or reconstructions, the few exceptions including the Tempietto longobardo at Cividale del Friuli or the Church of Santa Maria foris portas at Castelseprio. More examples have instead survived in southern Italy (Langobardia Minor), especially in what was the Duchy of Benevento: they include the city's walls, the church of Santa Sofia and the Rocca dei Rettori, one of the few surviving Lombard military structures, as well as other minor sites near Benevento and in the former duchy of Spoleto.
The main surviving examples of Lombard architecture have been included in the Longobards in Italy: Places of Power (568–774 A.D.) site. This consists of seven places with notable architectural, artistic and sculptural, and has been a UNESCO World Heritage Site since 2011.
