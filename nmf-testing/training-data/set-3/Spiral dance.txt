The spiral dance, also called the grapevine dance and the weaverâ€™s dance, is a traditional group dance practiced in Neopaganism in the United States, especially in feminist Wicca and the associated "Reclaiming" movement. 
It is designed to emphasize "community and rebirth", and is also used "to raise power in a ritual".
