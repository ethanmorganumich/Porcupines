Glass in green buildings
||||||
A green design concept is to facilitate sustainable use of the resources – energy, water and other materials – all through the complete life cycle of the building including its construction.Glass is a useful material that has such advantages such as Transparency, Natural Day-lighting, permitting a sky view and Acoustic control, depending on the glazing solution used. Glass is a wholly recyclable material.
Glass is beloved by architects as well as designers.
Glass can play a role in accomplishing greater indoor environmental quality and when used carefully can improve energy efficiency, however a measured approach needs to be taken to ensure the building loads are not excessively increased due to solar gain.
The intent of a green building design is to curtail the demand on non-renewable resources, amplify utilization efficiency of these resources when in use, and augment the reuse, recycling, and consumption of renewable resources.
