Architecture of Chile

Chilean architecture is influenced by the country's history, religious culture and unique climate. Chile was a former Spanish colony and its architectural style was therefore strongly influenced by Spanish design. Due to the unique geographical environment, Chilean architecture was also designed to accommodate these natural conditions. In particular, Chile's special geologic structure and resultant high incidence of earthquakes and tsunamis have led to  Chilean architects becoming quite experienced in the application of structures and materials for earthquake-resistant structures and post-disaster reconstruction.
