Finland-Swedish Sign Language
||||||
Finland-Swedish Sign Language (FinSSL) is a moribund sign language in Finland. It is now used only in private settings by older adults who attended the only Swedish school for the deaf in Finland (in Porvoo, Swedish: Borg√•), which was established in the mid-19th century by Carl Oscar Malm but closed in 1993. Some 90 persons have it as their native language. FinSSL is said to be a distinct language; however, "Finland-Swedish Deaf have few problems understanding Finnish signers". There had been, moreover, continuous input from Swedish Sign Language over its history.
