Wedding sari
||||||
A wedding sari is the traditional wedding dress of South Asian women. The sari is traditionally a combination of red and green, with golden brocade. 
Hindu wedding sarees are predominantly red, a colour associated with married women, and never white, a colour associated with widowed women. Sari fabric is also traditionally silk. Over time, colour options and fabric choices for Indian brides have expanded. Today fabrics like crÃªpe, Georgette, tissue and satin are used, and colours have been expanded to include gold, pink, orange, maroon, brown, and yellow as well. Indian brides in Western countries often wear the sari at the wedding ceremony and change into other traditional Indian wear afterwards such as lehenga, or cholis etc.
The types of wedding saris include Kanchipuram wedding sari, Banarasi wedding sari, Sambalpuri wedding sari, Assam silk, Gota sari, Resham sari, Zardosi sari, paithani sari, Bandhani sari, Neriyathum sari.
