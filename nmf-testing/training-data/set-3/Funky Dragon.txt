Funky Dragon
||||||
Funky Dragon (Welsh: Draig Ffynci) was the Children and Young People's Assembly for Wales. It was a peer-led organisation that provided opportunities for young people up to the age of 25 to have their voices heard on issues that affected them.
It worked closely with the Welsh Assembly Government and youth forums run by unitary authorities, enabling it to influence decision making at different political levels.
The Welsh government stopped funding the organisation in 2014. Deprived of their main financial support, Funky Dragon had no other choice but stop.
