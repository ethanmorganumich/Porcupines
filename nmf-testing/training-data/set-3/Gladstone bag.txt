Gladstone bag
||||||
A Gladstone bag is a small portmanteau suitcase built over a rigid frame which could separate into two equal sections. Unlike a suitcase, a Gladstone bag is "deeper in proportion to its length." Gladstones are typically made of stiff leather and often belted with lanyards. The bags are named after William Gladstone (1809â€“1898), the four-time Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.
