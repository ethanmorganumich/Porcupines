Cyberpolitics
||||||
Cyberpolitics is a term widely employed across the world, largely by academics interested in analyzing its breadth and scope, of the use of the Internet for political activity. It embraces all forms of social software. Cyberpolitics includes:   journalism, fundraising, blogging, volunteer recruitment, and organization building. 
The campaign of Howard Dean, in which a previously little-known former Democratic governor of a small state emerged for a while as the front runner for the 2004 Democratic presidential nomination on the strength of his campaign's skill in cyberpolitics, was a wake-up call to the American political establishments of political parties around the United States as to the importance of cyberpolitics as both a concept and as a series of organizational and communications strategies.
