Chef's uniform
||||||
The traditional chef's uniform (or chef's whites) includes a toque blanche ("white hat"), white double-breasted jacket, pants in a black-and-white houndstooth pattern, and apron. It is a common occupational uniform in the Western world. The chef buttons also have a meaning; while qualified chefs wear black buttons, students wear white buttons. Kitchen brigades used to be massive, although today, chefs must be occupied in various areas of the kitchen, thus, being in charge for only one section is hardly possible anymore.
