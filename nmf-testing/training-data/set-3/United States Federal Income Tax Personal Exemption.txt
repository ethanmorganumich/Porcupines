Personal exemption
||||||
Under United States tax law, a personal exemption is an amount that a resident taxpayer is entitled to claim as a tax deduction against personal income in calculating taxable income and consequently federal income tax. In 2017, the personal exemption amount was $4,050, though the exemption is subject to phase-out limitations. The personal exemption amount is adjusted each year for inflation. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminates personal exemptions for tax years 2018 through 2025.
The exemption is composed of personal exemptions for the individual taxpayer and, as appropriate, the taxpayer's spouse and dependents, as provided in Internal Revenue Code at 26 U.S.C. ยง 151.
