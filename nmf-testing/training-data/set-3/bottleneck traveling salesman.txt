Bottleneck traveling salesman problem
||||||
The Bottleneck traveling salesman problem (bottleneck TSP) is a problem in discrete or combinatorial optimization.  The problem is to find the Hamiltonian cycle (visiting each node exactly once) in a weighted graph which minimizes the weight of the highest-weight edge of the cycle. It was first formulated by Gilmore & Gomory (1964) with some additional constraints, and in its full generality by Garfinkel & Gilbert (1978).
