The architecture of Barcelona has had a parallel evolution to that of the rest of the Catalan and Spanish architecture, and has followed in diverse ways the multiple trends that have been produced in the context of the history of Western architecture. Throughout its history, Barcelona has welcomed various cultures and civilizations, which have contributed their concept of art and have left their legacy for posterity, from the first Iberian settlers, through the Roman colonizers, the Visigoths, and a brief Islamic period, until the emergence in the Middle Ages of Catalan art, language and culture, in which the Romanesque and Gothic were very fruitful periods for the artistic development of the region.
