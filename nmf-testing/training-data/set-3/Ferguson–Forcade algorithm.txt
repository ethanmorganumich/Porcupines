An integer relation between a set of real numbers x1, x2, ..., xn is a set of integers a1, a2, ..., an, not all 0, such that

  An integer relation algorithm is an algorithm for finding integer relations. Specifically, given a set of real numbers known to a given precision, an integer relation algorithm will either find an integer relation between them, or will determine that no integer relation exists with coefficients whose magnitudes are less than a certain upper bound.
