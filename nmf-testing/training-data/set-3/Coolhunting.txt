Coolhunting
||||||
Coolhunting is a neologism coined in the early 1990s referring to a new kind of marketing professionals who make observations and predictions in changes of new or existing  "cool" cultural fads and trends. Coolhunting is also referred to as "trend spotting," and is a subset of trend analysis.
Coolhunters resemble the intuitive fashion magazine editors of the 1960s such as Nancy White (Harper's Bazaar 1958â€“1971). Coolhunters operate mostly in the world of street fashion and design, but their work also blurs into that of futurists such as Faith Popcorn.
