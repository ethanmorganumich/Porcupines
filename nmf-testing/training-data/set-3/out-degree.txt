Degree (graph theory)
||||||
In graph theory, the degree (or valency) of a vertex of a graph is the number of edges that are incident to the vertex; in a multigraph, a loop contributes 2 to a vertex's degree, for the two ends of the edge. The degree of a vertex 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is denoted 
  
    
      
        deg
        ⁡
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \deg(v)}
   or 
  
    
      
        deg
        ⁡
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle \deg v}
  . The maximum degree of a graph 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
  , denoted by 
  
    
      
        Δ
        (
        G
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Delta (G)}
  , and the minimum degree of a graph, denoted by 
  
    
      
        δ
        (
        G
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \delta (G)}
  , are the maximum and minimum of its vertices' degrees. In the multigraph shown on the right, the maximum degree is 5 and the minimum degree is 0.
In a regular graph, every vertex has the same degree, and so we can speak of the degree of the graph. A complete graph (denoted 
  
    
      
        
          K
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle K_{n}}
  , where 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the number of vertices in the graph) is a special kind of regular graph where all vertices have the maximum possible degree, 
  
    
      
        n
        −
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n-1}
  .
In a signed graph, the number of positive edges connected to the vertex 
  
    
      
        v
      
    
    {\displaystyle v}
   is called positive deg
  
    
      
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (v)}
   and the number of connected negative edges is entitled negative deg
  
    
      
        (
        v
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle (v)}
