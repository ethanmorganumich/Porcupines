Maestoso
||||||
Maestoso (Italian pronunciation: [ma.eˈstoːzo]) is an Italian musical term and is used to direct performers to play a certain passage of music in a stately, dignified and majestic fashion (sometimes march-like) or, it is used to describe music as such.Maestoso also is associated with the advent of Classicism, Romanticism, and the newer forms of Neo-Classicism and Neo-Romanticism. The interpretation of maestoso is varied by the conductor depending upon the overall style in which the piece is written. Used as more of an interpretive choice, this term is not always associated with a specific tempo or tempo range.
