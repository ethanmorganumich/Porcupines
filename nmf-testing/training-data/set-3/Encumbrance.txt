Encumbrance
||||||
An encumbrance is a third party's right to, interest in, or legal liability on property that does not prohibit the property's owner from transferring title (but  may diminish its value). Encumbrances can be classified in several ways. They may be financial (for example, liens) or non-financial (for example, easements, private restrictions). Alternatively, they may be divided into those that affect title (for example, lien, legal or equitable charge) or those that affect the use or physical condition of the encumbered property (for example, restrictions, easements, encroachments). Encumbrances include security interests, liens, servitudes (for example, easements, wayleaves, real covenants, profits a prendre), leases, restrictions, encroachments, and air and subsurface rights.
