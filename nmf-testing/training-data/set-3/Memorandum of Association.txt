Memorandum of association
||||||
The memorandum of association of a company is an important corporate document in certain jurisdictions. It is often simply referred to as the memorandum.  In the UK, it has to be filed with the Registrar of Companies during the process of incorporating a company. It is the document that regulates the company's external affairs, and complements the articles of association which cover the company's internal constitution. It contains the fundamental conditions under which the company is allowed to operate. Until recently it had to include the "objects clause" which let the shareholders, creditors and those dealing with the company know what is its permitted range of operation, although this was usually drafted very broadly. It also shows the company's initial capital. It is one of the documents required to incorporate a company in India, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Canada, Nigeria, Nepal, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania and is also used in many of the common law jurisdictions of the Commonwealth.
