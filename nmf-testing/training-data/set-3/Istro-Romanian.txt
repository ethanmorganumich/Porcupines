Istro-Romanian language
||||||
The Istro-Romanian language (Istro Romanian: rumârește, vlășește) is a Balkan Romance language, spoken in a few villages and hamlets in the peninsula of Istria in Croatia, as well as in the diaspora of this people. It is sometimes abbreviated to IR.
While its speakers call themselves Rumeri, Rumeni, they are also known  as Vlachs, Rumunski, Ćići and Ćiribiri. The last one, used by ethnic Croats, originated as a disparaging nickname for the language, rather than its speakers.Due to the fact that its speakers are estimated to be less than 500, it is listed among languages that are "seriously endangered" in the UNESCO Red Book of Endangered Languages.It is also considered by some Romanian scholars to be an idiosyncratic offshoot dialect of Romanian.
