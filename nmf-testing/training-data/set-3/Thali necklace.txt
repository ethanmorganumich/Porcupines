Mangala sutra
||||||
A mangala sutra (IAST: maṅgala sūtra), or thaali (ISO: tāḷi), is a necklace that the groom ties around the bride's neck in the Indian subcontinent, in a ceremony called Mangalya Dharanam (Sanskrit for '"wearing the auspicious"'). The necklace serves as a visual marker of status as a married Hindu woman. Mangala sutra's origin dates back to the 6th Century AD as a single yellow thread was tied around the bride for protection from other men and evil spirits. Mangala sutra is a social practice widespread in India, Sri Lanka, and Nepal. The term mangala sutra in Sanskrit means holy thread.
