Beret
||||||
A beret (UK:  BERR-ay or US:  bə-RAY; French: [beʁɛ]; Basque: txapela, pronounced [tʃapela]) is a soft, round, flat-crowned cap, usually of woven, hand-knitted wool, crocheted cotton, wool felt, or acrylic fibre.
Mass production of berets began in 19th century France and Spain, and the beret remains associated with these countries. Berets are worn as part of the uniform of many military and police units worldwide, as well as by other organizations.
