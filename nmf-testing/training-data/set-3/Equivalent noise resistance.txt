In telecommunication, an equivalent noise resistance is a quantitative representation in resistance units of the spectral density of a noise-voltage generator, given by

  
    
      
        
          R
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              π
              
                W
                
                  n
                
              
            
            
              k
              
                T
                
                  0
                
              
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle R_{n}={\frac {\pi W_{n}}{kT_{0}}}}
  
where 
  
    
      
        
          W
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle W_{n}}
   is the spectral density, 
  
    
      
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle k}
   is the Boltzmann constant, 
  
    
      
        
          T
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle T_{0}}
   is the standard noise temperature (290 K), so 
  
    
      
        k
        
          T
          
            0
          
        
        =
        4.00
        ×
        
          10
          
            −
            21
          
        
        
        [
        W
        s
        ]
      
    
    {\displaystyle kT_{0}=4.00\times 10^{-21}\,[Ws]}
  .
Note:  The equivalent noise resistance in terms of the mean-square noise-generator voltage, e2, within a frequency increment, Δ f, is given by

  
    
      
        
          R
          
            n
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              e
              
                2

              k
              
                T
                
                  0
