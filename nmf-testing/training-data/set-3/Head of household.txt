Head of Household
||||||
Head of Household is a filing status for individual United States taxpayers. It provides preferential tax rates and a larger standard deduction for single people caring for qualifying dependents.
To use the Head of Household filing status, a taxpayer must:

Be unmarried or considered unmarried at the end of the year.
Have paid more than half the cost of keeping up a home for the tax year (either one's own home or the home of a qualifying parent).
Usually have a qualifying person who lived with the head in the home for more than half of the tax year unless the qualifying person is a dependent parent.Advocates of the head of household filing status argue that it is an important financial benefit to single parents, and particularly single mothers, who have reduced tax burdens as a result of the status. Critics, however, argue that it is poorly targeted, delivering larger benefits to those with high incomes and smaller benefits to those with low incomes; and point out that it creates marriage penalties and adds additional complexity to the tax code.
