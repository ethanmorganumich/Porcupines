Skew-symmetric matrix
||||||
In mathematics, particularly in linear algebra, a skew-symmetric (or antisymmetric or antimetric) matrix is a square matrix whose transpose equals its negative. That is, it satisfies the condition: p. 38 

In terms of the entries of the matrix, if 
  
    
      
        
          a
          
            i
            j
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle a_{ij}}
   denotes the entry in the 
  
    
      
        i
      
    
    {\textstyle i}
  -th row and 
  
    
      
        j
      
    
    {\textstyle j}
  -th column, then the skew-symmetric condition is equivalent to
