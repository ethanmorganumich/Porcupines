Parametric search
||||||
In the design and analysis of algorithms for combinatorial optimization, parametric search is a technique invented by Nimrod Megiddo (1983) for transforming a decision algorithm (does this optimization problem have a solution with quality better than some given threshold?) into an optimization algorithm (find the best solution). It is frequently used for solving optimization problems in computational geometry.
