As Turkey’s first EXPO, EXPO 2016 Antalya was held from April 22 to October 30, 2016. Starting with the philosophy of “Cultivating a Green Life for Future Generations”, EXPO 2016 Antalya has adopted the theme of “Flowers and Children” along with the motto “A Green Life for Future Generations” (Turkish: Gelecek Nesiller için Yeşil Bir Dünya). History, Bio-Diversity, Sustainability and Green Cities made up the four subthemes of EXPO 2016 Antalya.
EXPO 2016 Antalya, which hosted national and international congresses, panels, meetings and seminars, also provided cultural and artistic activities for its guests. 8 million locals and foreign visitors visited EXPO 2016 Antalya over its 6-month duration. EXPO 2016 Antalya was held on a 112-hectare exhibit site in Aksu. EXPO 2016 Antalya aimed at being the start of a new way of thinking, the intoxicating scent of flowers and the laughter of children throughout the city bringing with it hopes for a greener world.
