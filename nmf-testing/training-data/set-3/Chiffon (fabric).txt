Chiffon (fabric)
||||||
Chiffon (French: [ʃi.fɔ̃]; English: , shif-ON, from the French word chiffe which means "cloth or rag"; Arabic شف  šīff transparent, diaphanous, translucent fabric, or gauze; (عن 'an s.th.) to shimmer through, reveal) is a lightweight, balanced plain-woven sheer fabric, or gauze, like gossamer, woven of alternate S- and Z-twist crepe (high-twist) yarns.  The twist in the crepe yarns puckers the fabric slightly in both directions after weaving, giving it some stretch and a slightly rough feel.
