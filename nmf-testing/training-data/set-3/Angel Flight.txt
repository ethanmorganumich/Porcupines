Angel Flight
||||||
Angel Flight is the name used by a number of groups whose members provide free air transportation for passengers in need of medical treatment far from home and perform other missions of community service. Such a non-profit organization may be located in the United States, Europe, Australia, or Canada. Transportation is provided by volunteer pilots, often using their own general aviation aircraft. In most of Canada, the Volunteer Pilot Program of Hope Air provides a similar service, along with Angel Flight of Vancouver.
A list of all the Angel Flight and other Public Benefit Flying organizations is maintained by the Air Care Alliance.
