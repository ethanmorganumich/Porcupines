Antinaturalism (politics)
||||||
Antinaturalism, or anti-naturalism, is a movement arguing against naturalist and essentialist ideology; it is associated with antispeciesism, anti-racism, and feminism. Its philosophy is closely linked to the French animal rights movement and is also supported by xenofeminists, who advocate for a form of feminism holding that if nature is unjust, it should be changed, as well as transhumanists. Notable advocates include David Olivier and Yves Bonnardel.
