Temazcal
||||||
A temazcal [temasˈkal] is a type of sweat lodge, which originated with pre-Hispanic indigenous peoples in Mesoamerica. The term temazcal comes from the Nahuatl language, either from the words teme (to bathe) and calli (house), or from the word temāzcalli [temaːsˈkalːi] (house of heat).
