Raj pattern (Thai: ราชปะแตน, RTGS: ratcha pataen, pronounced [râːt.t͡ɕʰā.pā.tɛ̄ːn]) refers either to a Thai men's costume consisting of a white Nehru-style jacket with five buttons, a chong kraben, knee-length socks and dress shoes, or to the specific form of the jacket itself. It was worn chiefly during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries by government officials and the upper class in Bangkok, and nowadays is used in select circumstances as a national costume.
