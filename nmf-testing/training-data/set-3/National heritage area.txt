National Heritage Area
||||||
In the United States, a National Heritage Area (NHA) is a site designated by Act of Congress, intended to encourage historic preservation of the area and an appreciation of the history and heritage of the site. There are currently 55 NHAs, some of which use variations of the title, such as National Heritage Corridor.National Heritage Areas are not National Park Service units or federally owned or managed land. NHAs are administered by state governments or non-profit organizations or other private corporations, referred to as local coordinating entities. The National Park Service provides an advisory role and limited technical, planning and financial assistance.
Each area has its own authorizing legislation and a set of unique resources and goals. Areas considered for designation must have specific elements. First, the landscape must be a nationally unique natural, cultural, historic, or scenic resource.  Second, when the related sites are linked, they must tell a unique story about the U.S.The first NHA created, the Illinois & Michigan Canal National Heritage Corridor, located in Illinois, was signed into legislation by President Ronald Reagan on August 21, 1984.
The John D. Dingell Jr. Conservation, Management, and Recreation Act of 2019 laid out procedures for planning and management of NHAs and designated six new NHAs.
