In law, allocatur (from med. Lat. allocatur, "it is allowed") refers to the allowance of a writ or other pleading. It may also designate a certificate given by a taxing master, at the termination of an action, for the allowance of costs.The 1910 Black's Law Dictionary (Second Edition) described it as: "A word formerly used to denote that a writ or order was allowed", as well as a word "denoting the allowance by a master or prothonotary of a bill referred for his consideration, whether touching costs, damages, or matter of account". The dictionary also defined a "Special allocatur" as the "special allowance of a writ (particularly a writ of error) which is required in some particular cases" and an "Allocatur exigent" as a kind of writ "anciently issued in outlawry proceedings, on the return of the original writ of exigent".
