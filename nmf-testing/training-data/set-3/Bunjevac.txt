Bunjevci (Serbo-Croatian: Bunjevci / Буњевци, pronounced [bǔɲeːʋtsi, bǔː-]; singular masculine: Bunjevac / Буњевац, feminine: Bunjevka / Буњевка) are a South Slavic sub-ethnic group living mostly in the Bačka region of northern Serbia and southern Hungary (Bács-Kiskun County), particularly in Baja and surroundings, in Croatia (e.g. Primorje-Gorski Kotar County, Lika-Senj County, Slavonia, Split-Dalmatia County, Vukovar-Srijem County), and in Bosnia-Herzegovina. They presumably originate from western Herzegovina. As a result of the Ottoman conquest, some of them migrated to Dalmatia, from there to Lika and the Croatian Littoral, and in the 17th century to the Bácska region of Hungary.Bunjevci who remained in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as those in modern Croatia today, maintain that designation chiefly as a regional identity, and declare as ethnic Croats. Those who emigrated to Hungary were largely assimilated. In the 18th and 19th century they made up a significant part of the population of Bácska. The government of Hungary considers the Bunjevac community to be part of the Croatian minority.Bunjevci in Serbia and Hungary, are split between those who see themselves as a distinct ethnic group with their own language and those who identify themselves as a Croatian sub-ethnic group. The latter are represented in Serbia by the Croat National Council, and the former by the Bunjevac National Council.Bunjevci are mainly Roman Catholic and some are still able to speak the Shtokavian dialect of the Serbo-Croatian pluricentric language with Ikavian pronunciation with certain archaic characteristics. There are three sub-branches of the Shtokavian Younger Ikavian dialect: Danubian, Littoral-Lika, and Dalmatian.
