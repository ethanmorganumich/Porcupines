Jinbei
||||||
A jinbei (甚平) (alternately jinbē (甚兵衛) or hippari (ひっぱり)) is a traditional set of Japanese clothing worn by men, women and children during summer. Consisting of a side-tying, tube-sleeved kimono-style top and a pair of trousers, jinbei were originally menswear only, though in recent years, women's jinbei have become popular.
