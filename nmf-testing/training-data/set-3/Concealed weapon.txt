Concealed carry

Concealed carry, or carrying a concealed weapon (CCW), is the practice of carrying a weapon (usually a sidearm such as a handgun), either in proximity to or on one's person or in public places in a manner that hides or conceals the weapon's presence from the surrounding observers.  The opposite of concealed carry is called open carry.
While most law enforcement officers carry their handguns in a visible holster, some officers such as plainclothes detectives or undercover agents carry weapons in concealed holsters.  In some countries and jurisdictions, civilians are legally required to obtain a concealed carry permit in order to possess and carry a firearm.  In others, a CCW permit is only required if the firearm is not visible to the eye, such as carrying said weapon in one's purse, bag, trunk, etc.
