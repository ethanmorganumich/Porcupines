It is usually installed using a specialized equipment that is expensive and takes a skilled and experienced person to operate.  The equipment most often utilized in landscape curbing is based on a design that originated in Australia around the 1970s.Due to the need of professional installation, concrete landscape curbing is usually utilized as a complete system to create a permanent border.
Concrete landscape curbing can be used to highlight and emphasize a flowerbed or other landscaping area. Various colors and styles are available and the final look achieved will vary from installer to installer based on their level of training and experience.
