Architecture museum

An architecture museum is a museum dedicated to educating visitors about architecture in general or with a focus on a specific architectural style.  Architecture museums may also educate visitors on the traditional history of architecture or art, which can provide useful context for many architecture exhibits. They are often chartered with the principle of advancing public education on how design can positively impact the human environment. Some architecture museums, such as the Chicago Athenaeum also educate visitors in a variety of other related fields, such as urban design, landscape design, interior design, and historic preservation.
The world's first museum dedicated solely to the discipline of architecture was Shchusev Museum of Architecture in Moscow in 1934, followed by the Museum of Finnish Architecture in 1956. Other museums are not entirely dedicated to architecture but do contain architecture sections (such as Museums of Metz in Metz, France), architecture halls (such as Chicago Athenaeum, in Chicago, Illinois, US), or architecture galleries (such as University of South Australia's Architecture Museum in Mount Gambier, South Australia).
The International Confederation of Architectural Museums is an international organization for architecture museums. Members consist of museums, centers, collections and other institutions that offer permanent exhibitions or dedicated galleries on architecture.
