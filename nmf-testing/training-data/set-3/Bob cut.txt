Bob cut
||||||
A bob cut, also known as a bob, is a short to medium length haircut, in which the hair is typically cut straight around the head at approximately jaw level, but no longer than shoulder-length, often with fringe or bangs at the front. The standard bob cut exposes the back of the neck and keeps all of the hair well above the shoulders.
