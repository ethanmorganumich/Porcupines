Anti-environmentalism
||||||
Anti-environmentalism is a movement that favors loose environmental regulation in favor of economic benefits and opposes strict environmental regulation aimed at preserving nature and the planet. Anti-environmentalists seek to persuade the public that environmental policy impacts society negatively. The movement's goals include to counter the effects of environmental ideology and movements, to diminish public concern about the environment and to persuade politicians against increasing environmental regulations.Concern for economic growth is the source of anti-environmentalist beliefs. Anti-environmentalists weigh the benefits to the business sector of the economy more heavily than the consequences of lack of regulation has to the environment and inhabitants.Anti-environmentalists believe that humans do not need to interfere with the Earth's natural processes and therefore environmental regulation is unnecessary. Anti-environmentalists argue that the Earth's system is not as fragile as environmentalists maintain. They believe Earth will continue to maintain and restore itself through natural cycles as it did long before humans arrived and will continue to maintain itself long after humans are gone.
