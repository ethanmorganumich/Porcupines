Dastgāh (Persian: دستگاه) is a musical modal system in traditional Persian art music. Persian music consists of a number of principal musical modal systems or dastgāhs; in spite of 50 or more extant dastgāhs, theorists generally refer to a set of 12 principal ones. A dastgāh is a melody type that a performer uses as the basis of an improvised piece.
