Neck gaiter
||||||
A neck gaiter or neck warmer is a neckwear, or an enlarged collar of a garment, that is worn around the neck for warmth.  It is usually a closed tube of fabric, often thick fleece, merino wool, synthetic wicking, or knit material, which is slipped on and off over the head (unlike a scarf, which is an open stretch of fabric wrapped around the neck) to cover the entire neck and conserve body heat.  Some balaclavas are essentially a small hood attached to a neck gaiter.
Some longer neck gaiters can also be pulled up and cover the lower face as an improvised face veil to help keep out sand/dust, smoke and other airborne irritants from entering the mouth and nose, to prevent cold hives and/or frostbites by wind chills (especially on exposed nosetip), or to protect the facial skin from harmful sunlight during prolonged outdoor activities (e.g. recreational fishing).
