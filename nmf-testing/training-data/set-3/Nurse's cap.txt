Nurse's cap
||||||
A nurse's cap or nursing cap is part of the female nurse's uniform, introduced early in the history of the profession.  The cap's original purpose was to keep the nurse's hair neatly in place and present a modest appearance. Male nurses do not wear caps.
In some schools, a capping ceremony presents new nursing students their caps before beginning their clinical (hospital) training.
