Deobandi

Deobandi is a revivalist movement within Sunni Islam, adhering to the Hanafi school of law, formed in the late 19th century around the Darul Uloom Madrassa in Deoband, India, from which the name derives, by Muhammad Qasim Nanautavi, Rashid Ahmad Gangohi, and several others, after the Indian Rebellion of 1857–58. The movement pioneered education in religious sciences through the Dars-i-Nizami associated with the Lucknow-based ulema of Firangi Mahal with the goal of preserving Islamic teachings under colonial rule. The Deobandi movement's political wing, Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind, was founded in 1919 and played a major role in the Indian independence movement through its propagation of the doctrine of composite nationalism.Theologically, the Deobandis uphold the doctrine of taqlid (conformity to legal precedent) and adhere to the Hanafi school. Founders of the Deobandi school Nanautavi and Gangohi drew inspiration from the religio-political doctrines of the prominent South Asian Islamic scholar and Sufi reformer Shah Waliullah Dehlawi (1703–1762 CE / 1114–1175 AH). In its early years, the Deobandi school engaged in interfaith debates with Christian and Hindu scholars in a peaceful manner, and Deobandi philosophers talked about Hindu-Muslim unity, multiculturalism and opposition to the partition of India.Since 1979, the movement has been influenced by Salafism imported by United States from Saudi Arabia, particularly in Afghanistan and Pakistan. From the early 1980s to the early 2000s, some Deobandis were heavily funded by Saudi govt. The Pakistani government cultivated Deobandi militancy to fight the Soviet Union in Afghanistan and India in Kashmir. The money and guns supplied later fuelled civil conflict. The movement has spread from India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh to the United Kingdom, and has a presence in South Africa. The Pakistani and Afghan branches and the original Indian seminaries have far less contact since the Partition of India, for political reasons related to the India–Pakistan border. Followers of the Deobandi movement are extremely diverse; some advocate for non-violence and others are militant.
