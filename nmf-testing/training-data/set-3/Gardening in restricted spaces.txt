There are many ways to garden in restricted spaces. Often a small or limited space is an issue in growing and cultivating plants.  Restricted space gardens can be located on small lawns, balconies, patios, porches, rooftops, inside the home, or in any other available place.  Gardening in small places can be applied to edible or floral plants. Growing food has many benefits including saving money; healthier, fresher, and better tasting food; knowledge of pesticide and fertilizer exposure.  Gardening is a good form of exercise and has been proven to be therapeutic.
