Bondage pants
||||||
Bondage pants or bondage trousers are trousers with zippers, straps, chains, rings and buckles, giving an appearance of a BDSM style.
They come in a variety of colors and patterns; one of the most common patterns being tartan. They also come in a variety of styles, including tight or baggy, long, short or Capri.
They have mainly been worn by members of youth subcultures, including punks, ravers, goths and Otaku.
The more popular of the pants seems to be the 'original' black style, with white stitching, although different colored versions including white, hot pink, blue, and green have been made with equally varied colors of stitching.
There has been some controversy at certain schools in the United States about the bondage pants being a danger to school property and also for supposed sexual inappropriateness, even to the extent of banning the pants.
