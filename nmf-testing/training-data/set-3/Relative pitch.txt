Relative pitch
||||||
Relative pitch is the ability of a person to identify or re-create a given musical note by comparing it to a reference note and identifying the interval between those two notes. For example, if the note Do and Fa is played on a piano, a person with relative pitch would be able to identify the second note from the first note given that they know that the first note is Do without looking.
