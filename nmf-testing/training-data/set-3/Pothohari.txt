Pahari-Pothwari
||||||
The Indo-Aryan language spoken on the Pothohar Plateau in the far north of Pakistani Punjab, as well as in most of Pakistan's Azad Kashmir and in western areas of India's Jammu and Kashmir, is known by a variety of names, the most common of which are Pahari (English: ; an ambiguous name also applied to unrelated languages of India), and Pothwari (or Pothohari).
The language is transitional between Hindko and Standard Punjabi. There have been efforts at cultivation as a literary language, although a local standard has not been established yet.Grierson in his early 20th-century Linguistic Survey of India assigned it to a so-called "Northern cluster" of Lahnda (Western Punjabi), but this classification, as well as the validity of the Lahnda grouping in this case, have been called into question.In Kashmir, speakers of Pahari-Pothwari are known as Pahari people.
