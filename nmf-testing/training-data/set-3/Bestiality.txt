Zoophilia is a paraphilia involving a sexual fixation on non-human animals. Bestiality is cross-species sexual activity between humans and non-human animals. The terms are often used interchangeably, but some researchers make a distinction between the attraction (zoophilia) and the act (bestiality).In many parts of the world, bestiality is illegal under animal abuse laws or laws dealing with sodomy or crimes against nature.
