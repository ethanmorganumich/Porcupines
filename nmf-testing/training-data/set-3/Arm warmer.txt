Arm warmer
||||||
Arm warmers are knitted "sleeves" worn on the arms. Sometimes worn by dancers to warm up their bodies before class, they have also become somewhat of a fashion item, appearing in the fall.
Arm warmers can also describe any glove-like articles of clothing that lack finger coverings and/or were originally designed to keep wrists and lower arms warm. Today, many competition and sport bicyclists as well as distance runners/marathoners wear spandex-compression arm-warmers.
