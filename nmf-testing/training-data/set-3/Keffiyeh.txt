Keffiyeh
||||||
The keffiyeh or kufiya (Arabic: كُوفِيَّة, romanized: kūfīyah, lit. 'relating to Kufa'), also known in Arabic as a ghutrah (غُترَة), shemagh (شُمَاغ šumāġ), ḥaṭṭah (حَطَّة) and, in Persian, as a čafiya (چفیه) or čapiya (چپیه), is a traditional headdress worn by men.
It is fashioned from a square scarf, and is usually made of cotton. The keffiyeh is commonly found in arid regions, as it provides protection from sunburn, dust and sand. An agal is often used to keep it in place.
