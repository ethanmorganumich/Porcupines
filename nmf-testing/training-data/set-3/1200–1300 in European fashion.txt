1200â€“1300 in European fashion
||||||
Costume during the thirteenth century in Europe was very simple for both men and women, and quite uniform across the continent.  Male and female clothing was relatively similar, and changed very slowly, if at all.  Most clothing, especially outside the wealthier classes, remained little changed from three or four centuries earlier.  The century saw great progress in the dyeing and working of wool, which was by far the most important material for outerwear.  For the rich, colour and rare fabrics such as silk from the silkworm was very important.  Blue was introduced and became very fashionable, being adopted by the Kings of France as their heraldic colour.
