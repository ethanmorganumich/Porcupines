Pakol (Khowar: پاکول, Shina: پاکول, Pashto: پکول Urdu: پاکول یا پشتون ٹوپی) is a soft, flat, rolled-up, round-topped men's cap, usually worn in northern South Asia. It is typically made of wool and found in a variety of earthy colours, such as brown, black, grey, ivory, or dyed red using walnut. The Pakol is believed to have originated in Chitral, or Gilgit-Baltistan in Pakistan.
