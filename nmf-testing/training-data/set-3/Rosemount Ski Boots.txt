Rosemount Ski Boots
||||||
Rosemount Ski Boots introduced one of the earliest all-plastic ski boots for the downhill skiing market, competing with Bob Lange for the title of "first". Rosemount's design was easily distinguished by its use of the uncommon "side-entry" method for putting the boot on, which was rare at the time and is no longer used.
The boot was introduced by Rosemount Engineering, better known for their aerospace instrumentation. They referred to the boot division as either the Rosemount Consumer Products Division or Sports Technology.
Rosemount sold the factory to Bass Sports in 1968, but  the boots retained the Rosemount name throughout their production. Many variations of the design were introduced over the next four years, and Bass added ski bindings and ski poles as well. The rest of Rosemount became Rosemount Inc. when they were purchased by Emerson in 1976.
Bass Sports was in turn purchased by Raichle in 1972, who ended production of the Rosemount boot in favor of their own designs the next year. Ironically, one of the few other side-entry boot designs was the Raichle Fibre Jet (aka Red and Red Hot), another fiberglass design which was no longer in production.
