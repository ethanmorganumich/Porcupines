Internal Revenue Code section 183
||||||
Section 183 of the United States Internal Revenue Code (26 U.S.C. ยง 183), sometimes referred to as the "hobby loss rule," limits the losses that can be deducted from income which are attributable to hobbies and other not-for-profit activities.  Generally, losses which occur in for-profit activities are not limited and can be used to offset other income from other activities.  But the ยง 183 limitation curtails those deductions when the activity is deemed a hobby.
