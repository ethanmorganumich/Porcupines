Hime cut
||||||
The hime cut (Japanese: 姫カット, IPA: [çime katːo], HEE-meh; lit. 'princess cut') is a hairstyle consisting of straight, usually cheek-length sidelocks and frontal fringe. The rest of the hair is usually worn long and straightened. The style is thought to have originated, or at least become common, in the Imperial court during the Heian period (794–1185 CE) of Japanese history, when noble women would sometimes grow out their hair for their entire lives.
