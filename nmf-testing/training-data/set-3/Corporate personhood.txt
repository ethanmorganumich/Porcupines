Corporate personhood
||||||
Corporate personhood or juridical personality is the legal notion that a juridical person such as a corporation, separately from its associated human beings (like owners, managers, or employees), has at least some of the legal rights and responsibilities enjoyed by natural persons.  In most countries, a corporation has the same rights as a natural person to hold property, enter into contracts, and to sue or be sued.
