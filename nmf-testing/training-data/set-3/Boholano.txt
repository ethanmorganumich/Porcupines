Boholano dialect
||||||
Boholano (Cebuano: Binol-anon) is a variant of the Cebuano language spoken in the island province of Bohol in the Visayas and a major portion of Southern Leyte, as well as parts of Mindanao, particularly in Northern Mindanao and Caraga. It is sometimes erroneously described as a separate language even though Binol-anon originated as a dialect continuum of the Cebuano language.Boholano, especially as spoken in central Bohol, can be distinguished from other Cebuano variants by a few phonetic changes:

The semivowel y is pronounced [dʒ] as is the ll sound (similar to Spanish Yeísmo): iya is pronounced [iˈdʒa];
Ako is pronounced as [aˈho];
Intervocalic l is occasionally pronounced as [w] when following u or o: kulang is pronounced as [ˈkuwaŋ] (the same as Cebu City dialect).
