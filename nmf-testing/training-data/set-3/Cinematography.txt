Cinematography
||||||
Cinematography (from ancient Greek κίνημα, kìnema "movement" and γράφειν, gràphein "to write") is the art of motion picture (and more recently, electronic video camera) photography. 
Cinematographers use a lens to focus reflected light from objects into a real image that is transferred to some image sensor or light-sensitive material inside a movie camera. These exposures are created sequentially and preserved for later processing and viewing as a motion picture. Capturing images with an electronic image sensor produces an electrical charge for each pixel in the image, which is electronically processed and stored in a video file for subsequent processing or display. Images captured with photographic emulsion result in a series of invisible latent images on the film stock, which are chemically "developed" into a visible image. The images on the film stock are projected for viewing the same motion picture.
Cinematography finds uses in many fields of science and business, as well as for entertainment purposes and mass communication.
