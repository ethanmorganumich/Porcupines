Positive youth development (PYD) programs are designed to optimize youth developmental progress. Youth.gov states that "PYD is an intentional, prosocial approach that engages youth within their communities, schools, organizations, peer groups, and families in a manner that is productive and constructive; recognizes, utilizes, and enhances young peopleâ€™s strengths; and promotes positive outcomes for young people by providing opportunities, fostering positive relationships, and furnishing the support needed to build on their leadership strengths."PYD differs from other approaches to youth in that it rejects an emphasis on trying to correct what is considered wrong with children's behavior or development. Instead, youth development professionals live by the motto originally coined by Karen Pittman, "problem free is not fully prepared" as they work to grow youth into productive members of society. Moreover, seen through a PYD lens, young people are not regarded as "problems to be solved;" rather, they are seen as assets, allies, and agents of change who have much to contribute in solving the problems that affect them the most. Programs and practitioners seek to empathize with, educate, and engage children in productive activities. Though the field is still growing, PYD has been used across the world to address social divisions, such as gender and ethnic differences.
