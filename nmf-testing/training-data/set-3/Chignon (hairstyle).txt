Chignon (hairstyle)
||||||
A chignon (UK: , US: , French: [ʃiɲɔ̃]) is a popular type of hairstyle. The word "chignon" comes from the French phrase chignon du cou, which means nape of the neck.
Chignons are generally achieved by pinning the hair into a knot at the nape of the neck or at the back of the head, but there are many variations of the style. They are usually secured with accessories such as barrettes or hairpins. Chignons are frequently worn for special occasions, like weddings and formal dances, but the basic chignon is also worn for everyday casual wear.
