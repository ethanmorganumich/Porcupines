Coppola cap
||||||
The coppola (Italian pronunciation: [ˈkɔppola]) is a traditional kind of flat cap typically worn in Sicily and Calabria, where is it known as còppula or berretto, and also seen in Malta, Corsica, and Sardinia (where it came to be known, in the local language, as berritta, cicía, and bonete or bonetu, possibly from the Latin abonnis).
Today, the coppola is widely regarded, at least in Italy, as an iconic symbol of Sicilian or Calabrian heritage.
