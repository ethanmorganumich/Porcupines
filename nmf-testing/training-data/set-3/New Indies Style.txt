New Indies Style (Dutch: Nieuwe Indische Bouwstijl) is a modern architectural style used in the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) between the late 19th-century through pre-World War II 20th-century. New Indies Style is basically early modern (western) architecture (e.g. Rationalism and Art Deco), which applies local architectural elements such as wide eaves or prominent roof as an attempt to conform with the tropical climate of Indonesia.Even though New Indies Style refers specifically to the Dutch Rationalism movement that appeared in 1910s Indonesia, for the purpose of covering the many architectural styles that appeared during the brief early modern period, the term is used as a general term for all the architectural styles that appear between the late 19th-century to pre-World War II 20th-century.
