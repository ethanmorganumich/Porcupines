The Ingush (, Ingush: ГIалгIай, romanized: Ghalghaj, pronounced [ˈʁəlʁɑj]) are, per Oxford dictionary, "member[s] of a people living mainly in Ingushetia in the central Caucasus." Ingushetia is a federal republic of Russian Federation. The Ingush are predominantly Sunni Muslims and speak the Ingush language. According to 19th-century scientist Semen Bronevski, the Ingush are known variously as Kisti, Ghalgha, and Ingushi, and they use these names interchangeably. According to German scientist Peter Pallas, who visited the Caucasus, the Ingush are known variously as Loamaro, Kisti, Ghalghai, and Ingush.
