Personal and social education (PSE) is a component of the state school curriculum in Scotland and Wales. PSE became a statutory requirement in schools in September 2003, and is compulsory for all students at key stages 1, 2, 3 and 4 (5 to 16 years old), and shares some similar elements with Personal, social, health and economic education and citizenship education in England. These include:

local and global communities
sex education
spirituality
morals
environmental issues
