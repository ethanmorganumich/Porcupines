Bell sleeve
||||||
A bell sleeve can be either long or short and is usually set smoothly into the armscye (no pleating or shirring) and flares toward the bottom. Bell sleeves end anywhere from the elbow to the wrist. Flared sleeves ending at the upper bicep are similarly shaped, but are instead called butterfly sleeves.  The effect is reminiscent of a bell in its shape.  If the sleeve is relatively full in circumference and is gathered or pleated into both the armhole and at the bottom, it is called a Bishop's Sleeve.
