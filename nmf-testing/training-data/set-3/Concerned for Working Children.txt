||||||
The Concerned for Working Children (CWC) is a non-profit organisation based in Bangalore, India and known internationally for its work in empowering children to become the key protagonists in solving their own problems. While eradication of child labour remains the key focus of CWC, the organisation opposes simple criminalisation and addresses related issues such as children's rights, gender equality, community development, education and advocacy. Founded in 1985, it has organised Bhima Sangha, a union of and for working children that now has 20,000 members, and launched the National Movement of Working Children. Internationally, it co-founded the International Working Group on Child Labour (IWGCL), and CWC child delegates have contributed to ILO (International Labour Organization) conferences on child labour.
CWC believes that given political and social space, marginalised children could become protagonists of their own change. With the support of the Concerned for Working Children, active participation of children in understanding problems that affect them and in devising appropriate solutions, has led to the creation of 'Makkala Panchayats' (Children's Village Governing Bodies) in many parts of Karnataka.
CWC is playing a part in international research into children's mobility issues, with agreement on greater involvement of children in all aspects of this research project.
CWC receives funding support from a Norwegian charity and CWC has been first NGO from Bengaluru to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize and holds a legacy for being nominated for the same for three years consecutively for the years 2012, 2013 and 2014, for its pioneering works in the field of children's participation globally. The nomination for the award was filed by three Norwegian parliamentarians on learning about the contributions of the NGO through a blogger from their country who shared his experience on a visit to India and serving at CWC and the parliamentarians mentioned the same in their nomination letter as,“The organisation and its network have been pioneers in children’s participation within research, public planning, youth democracy, media and other areas. Few other local organisations elsewhere have contributed as much to this work”.
