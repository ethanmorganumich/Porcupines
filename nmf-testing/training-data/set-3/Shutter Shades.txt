Shutter shades
||||||
Shutter shades, also known as slatted shades,  louvered shades, or Venetian blind shades are sunglasses that, instead of having darkened lenses, have horizontal slats similar to window shutters, which are an integral part of the frame. 
The shades are marketed as suitable for both men and women and are available in an assortment of styles and colors. Depending on the design, shutter shades may not function as sunglasses; although some models contain UV resistant lenses, many do not. The horizontal plastic "shades" neither provide protection for the eye from UV light nor prevent a substantial amount of light from entering the eye.
