English Baroque architecture

English Baroque is a term used to refer to modes of English architecture that paralleled Baroque architecture in continental Europe between the Great Fire of London (1666) and roughly 1720, when the flamboyant and dramatic qualities of Baroque art were abandoned in favor of the more chaste, rule-based neo-classical forms espoused by the proponents of Palladianism.
