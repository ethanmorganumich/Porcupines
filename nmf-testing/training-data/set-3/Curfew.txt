Curfew
||||||
A curfew is a government order specifying a time during which certain regulations apply. Typically, curfews order all people affected by them to not be in public places or on roads within a certain time frame, typically in the evening and nighttime hours. Such an order may be issued by public authorities but also by the owner of a house to those living in the household. For instance, an au pair was typically given a curfew, which regulates when they must return to the host family's home in the evening.
Curfews were a common element of control used in martial law, though curfews can also be implemented for public safety in the event of a disaster, pandemic, or crisis.
