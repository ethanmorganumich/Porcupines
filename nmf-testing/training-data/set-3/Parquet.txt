Parquetry
||||||
Parquet (French: [paʁkɛ]; French for "a small compartment") is a geometric mosaic of wood pieces used for decorative effect in flooring.
Parquet patterns are often entirely geometrical and angular—squares, triangles, lozenges—but may contain curves.  The most popular parquet flooring pattern is herringbone.
