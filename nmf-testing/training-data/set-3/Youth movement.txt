Nashi (Russian: Молодёжное демократическое aнтифашистское движение «Наши», Molodezhnoye demokraticheskoye antifashistskoye dvizhenye "Nashi" Youth Democratic Anti-Fascist Movement "Ours!") was a political youth movement in Russia, which declared itself to be a democratic, anti-fascist, anti-"oligarchic-capitalist" movement. Senior figures in the Russian Presidential administration encouraged the formation of the group, which Moises Naim labelled a government organized non-governmental organization (GONGO). By late 2007, it had grown in size to some 120,000 members aged between 17 and 25. On April 6, 2012, the Nashi leader announced that the current form of the movement would dissolve in the near future, possibly to be replaced by a different organisation. He stated that Nashi had been "compromised" during the 2012 Russian presidential election.In 2013, the organization ceased its activities and on December 2, 2019, the legal entity was liquidated.Western critics have detected a "deliberately cultivated resemblance to" the Soviet Komsomol or to the Hitler Youth and dubbed the group "Putinjugend".
