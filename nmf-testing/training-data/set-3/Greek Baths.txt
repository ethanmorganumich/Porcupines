Greek baths

Greek baths were bath complexes suitable for bathing and cleaning in ancient Greece, similar in concept to that of the Roman baths. Greek baths are a feature of some Hellenized countries. These baths have been found in Greece, Egypt, Italy, and there is even one located in Marseille, France. Some of the first baths have been dated back to the 5th century BCE. The public baths had a gradual development into the flourishing, culturally-significant structures of the Hellenistic age. The multiple locations of the baths throughout the Mediterranean offer different, culturally-unique developments.Greek baths did not have to follow the same design and construction rules as temples or other civic buildings in Greece and, thus, the baths were very innovative. Greek baths were always the same in their functions, but not the same in their designs. Despite the variability dependent on each location and population, there are certain features that have come to define the Greek bath. Some of the prominent elements include tholoi, hip baths and other types of baths and pools, and heating and water systems. The importance of Greek baths grew overtime and became an important part to the cultures they had involvement with. In many of these cities there was a transition from individual baths to more communal baths and other spaces. Even in places that didn't embrace the communal pools, there was still a drastic development in the technology of bath houses and the importance of bathing for relaxation as well as cleanliness.
