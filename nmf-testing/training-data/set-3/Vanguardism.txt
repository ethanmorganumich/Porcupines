Vanguardism
||||||
Vanguardism in the context of Leninist revolutionary struggle, relates to a  strategy whereby the most  class-conscious and politically "advanced" sections of the proletariat or working class, described as the revolutionary vanguard, form organizations. They take actions to draw larger sections of the working class toward revolutionary politics and to serve as manifestations of proletarian political power opposed to the bourgeois.
