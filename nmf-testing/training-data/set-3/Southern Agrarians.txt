Southern Agrarians
||||||
The Southern Agrarians were twelve American Southerners  who wrote an agrarian literary manifesto in 1930. They and their essay collection, Iâ€™ll Take My Stand: The South and the Agrarian Tradition, contributed to the Southern Renaissance, the reinvigoration of Southern literature in the 1920s and 1930s. They were based at Vanderbilt University in Nashville. John Crowe Ransom was their unofficial leader, though Robert Penn Warren became their most prominent member. The membership overlaps with The Fugitives.
