Arias~Musical terminology~

Concert aria
||||||
A concert aria is normally a free-standing aria or opera-like scene (scena) composed for singer and orchestra, written specifically for performance in concert rather than as part of an opera. Concert arias have often been composed for particular singers, the composer always bearing that singer's voice and skill in mind when composing the work.
Apart from only denoting arias for singer and orchestra, the term is also used to indicate arias which were specifically composed as insertion arias for already-existing operas, either as additions to the score or as substitutions for other arias. These are sometimes performed in concerts because they are no longer required for their original purpose, though they were not, strictly speaking, composed for performance in concert.
The concert arias which are most commonly performed today were written by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, but there are many examples by other composers, such as:

"Son qual nave ch'agitata" by Riccardo Broschi (written for the famous castrato Farinelli)
"Ermina" by Juan Arriaga
"Ah! perfido" by Ludwig van Beethoven
"Der Wein" for soprano and orchestra by Alban Berg
"Scena di Berenice" by Joseph Haydn
"Infelice!" by Felix Mendelssohn
