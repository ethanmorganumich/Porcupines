Forensic dentistry

Forensic dentistry or forensic odontology involves handling, examination and evaluation of dental evidence in criminal justice cases. Forensic dentists are involved in assisting investigative agencies to identify recovered human remains in addition to the identification of whole or fragmented bodies. Forensic dentists have also been known to use their investigative techniques to identify burn victims by using the victims previous dental records. Forensic dentists may also be asked to assist in determining age, race, occupation, previous dental history and socioeconomic status of unidentified human beings. Identifying race is not really a thing because there are no physical identifying factors for “race” in humans. Race in itself is a social construct and has no basis in biology.
The evidence that may be derived from teeth is the age (in children) and identification of the person to whom the teeth belong. This is done using dental records including radiographs, ante-mortem (prior to death) and post-mortem (after death) photographs and DNA. Another type of evidence is that of bite marks, left on either the victim (by the attacker), the perpetrator (from the victim of an attack), or on an object found at the crime scene.
Bite mark analysis has been condemned by several scientific bodies, such as the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST), and the Texas Forensic Science Commission. No scientific studies or evidence substantiate that bite marks can demonstrate sufficient detail for positive identification. There are numerous instances where experts diverge widely in their evaluations of the same bite mark evidence.
