Piping (sewing)
||||||
In sewing, piping is a type of trim or embellishment consisting of a strip of folded fabric so as to form a "pipe" inserted into a seam to define the edges or style lines of a garment or other textile object. Usually the fabric strip is cut on the bias.  It may be made from either self-fabric (the same fabric as the object to be ornamented) or contrasting fabric, or of leather.Today, piping is common on upholstery and decorative pillows, but it is also used on clothing.  Piped pocket openings, garment edges, and seams are characteristic of Western wear.
