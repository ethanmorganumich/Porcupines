MacOS Server
||||||
macOS Server, formerly Mac OS X Server and OS X Server, is a discontinued series of Unix-like server operating systems developed by Apple Inc., based on macOS and later add-on software packages for the latter. macOS Server added server functionality and system administration tools to macOS and provided tools to manage both macOS-based computers and iOS-based devices.
Versions of Mac OS X Server prior to version 10.7 “Lion” were sold as complete, standalone server operating systems; starting with Mac OS X 10.7 “Lion,” Mac OS X Server (and its successors OS X Server and macOS Server) have been offered as add-on software packages, sold through the Mac App Store, that are installed on top of a corresponding macOS installation.macOS Server at one point provided network services such as a mail transfer agent, AFP and SMB servers, an LDAP server, and a domain name server, as well as server applications including a Web server, database, and calendar server. The latest version of macOS server only includes functionality related to user and group management, Xsan, and mobile device management through profiles.
On April 21, 2022, Apple announced it would be discontinuing macOS Server and that future versions of macOS would drop support for it.
