Criminal negligence
||||||
In criminal law, criminal negligence is a surrogate state of mind required to constitute a conventional (as opposed to strictly liable) offense. It is not, strictly speaking, a mens rea (Law Latin for "guilty mind") because it refers to an objective standard of behaviour expected of the defendant and does not refer to their mental state.
