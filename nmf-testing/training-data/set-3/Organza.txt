Organza
||||||
Organza is a thin, plain weave, sheer fabric traditionally made from silk. Many modern organzas are woven with synthetic filament fibers such as polyester or nylon. Silk organza is woven by a number of mills along the Yangtze River and in the province of Zhejiang in China. A coarser silk organza is woven in the Bangalore area of India. Deluxe silk organzas are woven in France and Italy.Organza is used for bridalwear and eveningwear. Other uses include hair accessories. In recent years, organza puff sleeves came into trend, and organza is now worn during the daytime. In the interiors market, it is used for effects in bedrooms and between rooms. Double-width organzas in viscose and acetate are used as sheer curtains.
The term may derive from French organsin, ultimately from the Central Asian city of Urgench, the midpoint of the Northern Silk Road.
