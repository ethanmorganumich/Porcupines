Docket (court)
||||||
A docket in the United States is the official summary of proceedings in a court of law.  In the United Kingdom in modern times it is an official document relating to delivery of something, with similar meanings to these two elsewhere. In the late nineteenth century the term referred to a large folio book in which clerks recorded all filings and court proceedings for each case, although use has been documented  since 1485.
