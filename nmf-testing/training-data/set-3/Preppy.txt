Preppy (also spelled preppie) or prep (all abbreviations of the word preparatory) is a subculture in the United States associated with the alumni of old private Northeastern college preparatory schools. The terms are used to denote a person seen as characteristic of a student or alumnus of these schools. Characteristics of preps in the past include a particular subcultural speech, vocabulary, dress, mannerisms and etiquette, reflective of an upper-class, old money upbringing.
