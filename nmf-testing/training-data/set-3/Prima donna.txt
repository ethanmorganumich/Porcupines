Prima donna
||||||
In opera or commedia dell'arte, a prima donna ([ˈpriːma ˈdɔnna]; Italian for "first lady"; plural: prime donne) is the leading female singer in the company, the person to whom the prime roles would be given. 
Prime donne often had grand off-stage personalities and were seen as demanding of their colleagues. From its original usage in opera, the term has spread in contemporary usage to refer to anyone behaving in a demanding or temperamental fashion, or having an inflated view of oneself and a self-centered attitude.
The prima donna in opera was normally, but not necessarily, a soprano. The corresponding term for the male lead (usually a castrato in the 17th and 18th centuries, later a tenor) is primo uomo.
