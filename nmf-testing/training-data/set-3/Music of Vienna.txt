Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria, and has long been one of the major centers for cultural development in central Europe.
Music organizations in Vienna include the Gesellschaft der Musikfreunde, which has been promoting musical development in the city since 1812.  The Vienna Boys Choir has an even longer history, dating back to 1498, while the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra is also renowned [1].
Major music venues in Vienna include the State Opera House, the People's Opera House, the Burgtheater, and the Theater an der Wien, the former three of which are owned by the federal government [2].
