Hanbok
||||||
The hanbok (Korean: 한복; Hanja: 韓服; RR: hanbok; lit. Korean clothing; term used in South Korea), also called Chosŏn-ot (Korean: 조선옷; Hanja: 朝鮮옷; RR: Joseon-ot; Chinese: 朝鮮服; pinyin: cháoxiǎnfú) in North Korea and China, is an umbrella term which is used to refer to traditional ethnic Korean clothes, including the traditional clothing of the chaoxianzu (Korean Chinese), an officially recognized ethnic minority in China. The term "hanbok"  literally means "Korean clothing". Due to the isolation from each other for about 50 years, the styles of hanbok in South Korea, North Korea, and China, worn by the Korean ethnics from these three countries have developed separately from each other.: 246  Since the 1990s, the South Korean-style and the North Korean-style have been looking more and more similar to each other. Similarly, since the Chinese economic reform of China, there have been more exchanges with both Koreas leading to both the development and changes in Korean-Chinese-style Chosŏn-ot in China; some of designs of the Korean-Chinese-style Chosŏn-ot have been influenced and inspired by both South-Korean and North Korean hanbok designs.: 246 Earliest visual depictions of hanbok can be traced back to the Three Kingdoms of Korea period (57 BC to 668 AD) with roots in the Proto-Koreanic people of what is now northern Korea and Northeast China (Manchuria); it can also be found in the arts of the Goguryeo tomb murals of the same period from the 4th to 6th century AD, where the basic structure of the hanbok was established at least since this period. The ancient hanbok consisted of a jeogori (top), baji (pants), chima (skirt), and the po (coat). The basic structure of hanbok was designed to facilitate the ease of movement and integrated many motifs of Mu-ism. These basic structural features of the hanbok remains relatively unchanged to this day. However, present-day hanbok, which is worn nowadays, is patterned after the hanbok worn in the Joseon dynasty, especially those worn by the nobility and royalty.: 104  In the past, however, commoners (seomin), were not allowed to wear what is now known as hanbok and instead wore minbok (clothing of commoners) which was typically white or off-white in colours; the commoners were only allowed to wear hanbok on their wedding day and on special occasions.: 104  The extensive use of white clothing among the commoners lead to Korea being referred as "dressed people of white". Nowadays, contemporary Koreans wear hanbok for formal or semi-formal occasions and events such as weddings, festivals, celebrations, and ceremonies. In 1996, the South Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism established "Hanbok Day" to encourage South Korean citizens to wear the hanbok.
