Dangui (Korean: 당의; Hanja: 唐衣; lit. Tang clothing; also written with the Hanja characters《唐衣服》; Korean pronunciation: [tɐŋɰi]), was also called dang-jeogori (당저고리; 唐赤古里; lit. Tang jeogori), dang-jeoksam (당적삼; 唐的衫; lit. Tang's robe), dang-hansam (당한삼; 唐汗衫; lit. Tang sweat robe), danggoui (당고의; 唐串衣), and samja (삼자; 衫子; lit. shirt),  is a type of jeogori (upper garment) for women in hanbok, the Korean traditional clothing, which was worn for ceremonial occasions during the Joseon dynasty. It was typically a garment item reserved for the upper class and commoners of this period would rarely see anyone in this garment. It was worn as a simple official outfit or for small national ceremonies while court ladies wore it as a daily garment.
