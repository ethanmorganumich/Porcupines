Climate-friendly gardening
||||||
Climate-friendly gardening is a form of gardening that can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases from gardens and encourage the absorption of carbon dioxide by soils and plants in order to aid the reduction of global warming.
To be a climate-friendly gardener means considering both what happens in a garden and the materials brought into it and the impact they have on land use and climate.
It can also include garden features or activities in the garden that help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions elsewhere.
