Bouclé
||||||
Bouclé is a looped yarn or the resulting fabric woven from this yarn.
The yarn is made from a length of loops of similar size, which can range from tiny circlets to large curls. To make bouclé, at least two strands are combined, with the tension on one strand being much looser than the other as it is being plied, resulting in the loose strand (known as the "effect yarn") forming the loops, with the other strand acting as the anchor.The fabric woven from bouclé yarn maintains this looped appearance and is also called bouclé.
