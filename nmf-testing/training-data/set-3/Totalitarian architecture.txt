Totalitarian architecture

Totalitarian architecture is a type of architecture or an architectural style approved by and often preferred by dictatorships and governments of totalitarian regimes, intended to strengthen and spread their ideology. The style of totalitarian architecture shows a preference for "classical symbolism and monumentality", drawing on simplified neo-Classicism and realism.Many aspects of the culture in totalitarian countries have been described as supporting the leaders and the ideology of the regime. In 2009, Theodore Dalrymple criticized Le Corbusier as one of creators of totalitarian architecture. He described brutalist structures as an expression of totalitarianism given that their grand, concrete-based design involves destroying gentler, more-human places such as gardens. In 1949, George Orwell described the Ministry of Truth in Nineteen Eighty-Four as an "enormous, pyramidal structure of white concrete, soaring up terrace after terrace, three hundred metres into the air." The Times columnist Ben Macintyre wrote that it was "a prescient description of the sort of totalitarian architecture that would soon dominate the Communist bloc." In contrast to these views, several authors have seen brutalism and socialist realism as modernist art forms which brought an ethos and sensibility in art.
