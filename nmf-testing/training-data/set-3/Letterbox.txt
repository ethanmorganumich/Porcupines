Letterboxing (filming)
||||||
Letterboxing is the practice of transferring film shot in a widescreen aspect ratio to standard-width video formats while preserving the film's original aspect ratio.  The resulting videographic image has mattes (black bars) above and below it; these mattes are part of each frame of the video signal.  LBX and LTBX are identifying abbreviations for films and images thus formatted.
