Grid file
||||||
In computer science, a grid file or bucket grid is a point access method which splits a space into a non-periodic grid where one or more cells of the grid refer to a small set of points. Grid files (a symmetric data structure) provide an efficient method of storing these indexes on disk to perform complex data lookups.
It provides a grid of n-dimensions where n represents how many keys can be used to reference a single point.
Grid files do not contain any data themselves but instead contain references to the correct bucket.
