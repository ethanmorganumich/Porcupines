Free-space path loss
||||||
In telecommunication, the free-space path loss (FSPL) is the attenuation of radio energy between the feedpoints of two antennas that results from the combination of the receiving antenna's capture area plus the obstacle-free, line-of-sight path through free space (usually air).  The "Standard Definitions of Terms for Antennas",  IEEE Std 145-1993, defines "free-space loss" as "The loss between two isotropic radiators in free space, expressed as a power ratio."  It does not include any power loss in the antennas themselves due to imperfections such as resistance.   Free space loss increases with the square of distance between the antennas because the radio waves spread out by the inverse square law and decreases with the square of the wavelength of the radio waves.   The FSPL is rarely used standalone, but rather as a part of the Friis transmission formula, which includes the gain of antennas.  It is a factor that must be included in the power link budget of a radio communication system, to ensure that sufficient radio power reaches the receiver such that the transmitted signal is received intelligibly.
