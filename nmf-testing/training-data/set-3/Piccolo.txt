The piccolo ( PIH-kə-loh; Italian for 'small') is a half-size flute and a member of the woodwind family of musical instruments. Sometimes referred to as a ‘baby flute’, the modern piccolo has most of the same fingerings as its larger sibling, the standard transverse flute, but the sound it produces is an octave higher than written. This has given rise to the name ottavino (Italian pronunciation: [otːaˈviːno]), by which the instrument is called in Italian and thus also in scores of Italian composers.

In the orchestral setting, the piccolo player is often designated as "piccolo/flute III" or "assistant principal." Larger orchestras have designated this position as a solo position due to the demands of the literature. Piccolos are often orchestrated to double the violins or the flutes, adding sparkle and brilliance to the overall sound because of the aforementioned one-octave transposition upwards. The piccolo is almost always used in concert band ensembles.
