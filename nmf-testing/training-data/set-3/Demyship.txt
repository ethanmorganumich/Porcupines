Demyship
||||||
A demyship is a form of scholarship at Magdalen College, Oxford.  It is derived from demi-socii or half-fellows, being historically entitled to half the allowance awarded to Fellows. The allowance is now, however, a token award of Â£200 per year. "Demy" and "demies" are pronounced to rhyme with "deny" and "surmise", rather than "semi(s)". Whilst Magdalen is unique amongst Oxbridge colleges in using the term Demies, Merton College, Oxford is similarly unusual in designating their scholars "postmasters".
