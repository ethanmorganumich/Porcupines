Lydian augmented scale
||||||
In music, the Lydian augmented scale (Lydian â™¯5 scale) is the third mode of the ascending melodic minor scale or jazz minor scale.
Starting on C, the notes would be as follows:

Generically the whole and half steps are:

-  W -  W -  W -  W -  H -  W -  H -

The scale may be thought of as a major scale with an augmented fourth and fifth, or as the relative to the melodic minor ascending scale (C Lydian augmented and A melodic minor ascending share the same notes).
