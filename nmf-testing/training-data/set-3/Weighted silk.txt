Weighted silk
||||||
Weighted silk is silk which has been treated to restore or increase the weight lost during the process of degumming.  This processing started in the 19th century, with vegetable-based solutions such as tannins or sugar. Chemical solutions based upon salts of lead or tin were then used, as well as silicate, phosphate of soda, and astringent extracts. These increased the weight considerably, but led to accusations of adulteration as the properties of the silk were impaired.
