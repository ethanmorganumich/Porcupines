Addendum
||||||
An addendum or appendix, in general, is an addition required to be made to a document by its author subsequent to its printing or publication. It comes from the gerundive addendum, plural addenda, "that which is to be added," from addere (lit.â€‰''give toward'', compare with memorandum, agenda, corrigenda).
