Obi (martial arts)
||||||
Many Japanese martial arts feature an obi (Japanese: å¸¯) as part of their exercise outfit. Such an obi is often made of thick cotton and is about 5 cm wide. The martial arts obi are most often worn in the koma-musubi knot (square knot); in practice where a hakama is worn, the obi is tied in other ways.
In many martial arts, the colour of the obi signifies the wearer's skill level. Usually the colours start from white for beginners and end in black or red-and-white for masters.
