Sarpech
||||||
The sarpech (Urdu: سرپیچ/Hindi: सरपेच, from Persian), also known as an aigrette, is a turban ornament that was worn by significant Hindu, Sikh and Muslim princes. Sar means "head" or "front" and pech means "screw", giving the word "sarpech" the literal meaning "that which is screwed onto the front (of the turban)". The sarpech was also worn in Persia, where it was known as jikka or jiqa (Persian: جقه), meaning "crest" or "tuft", and in Turkey, where it was known as  the sorguch, a name considered a corrupt form of the Persian word sarpush.
In India, dominantly two kinds of turban ornaments exist: the sarpech and the Kalgi (ornament).
