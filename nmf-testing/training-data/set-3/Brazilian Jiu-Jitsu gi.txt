||||||
The (Brazilian jiu-jitsu) Gi is a uniform for training  in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, adapted from the keikogi (稽古着) used in modern Japanese martial arts. A Gi, meaning dress or clothes, is typically composed of a heavy cotton jacket, reinforced drawstring trousers, and a belt which communicates rank. The Brazilian jiu-jitsu gi is also sometimes referred to as kimono by non-Japanese speakers. Some Jiu-Jitsu school systems avoid using a gi.
