Christian head covering
||||||
Christian head covering, also known as Christian veiling, is the traditional practice of women covering their head in a variety of Christian denominations. Some Christian women, based on historic Oriental Orthodox, Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic, Lutheran, Moravian, Reformed, Anglican, Methodist, Baptist and Plymouth Brethren teaching, wear the head covering in public worship and during private prayer at home (though some women belonging to these traditions may also choose to wear the head covering outside of prayer and worship), while others, especially traditional Anabaptist Christians, believe women should wear head coverings at all times, based on Saint Paul's dictum that Christians are to "pray without ceasing" and Saint Paul's teaching that women being unveiled is dishonourable. Genesis 24:65 records the veil as a feminine emblem of modesty. Manuals of early Christianity, including the Didascalia Apostolorum and PÃ¦dagogus instructed that a headcovering must be worn by women during prayer and worship, as well as when outside the home.The practice of Christian head covering for "praying and prophesying" is taught in the traditional interpretation of 1 Corinthians 11:2-10 in the New Testament of the Bible. The majority of Biblical scholars have held that "verses 4-7 refer to a literal veil or covering of cloth" for "praying and prophesying" and verse 15 to refer to the hair of a woman given to her by nature. Christian headcovering with a cloth veil was the practice of the early Church, being universally taught by the Church Fathers and practiced by Christian women throughout history, continuing to be the ordinary practice among Christians in many parts of the world, such as Romania, Russia, Ukraine, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, and South Korea; additionally, among Conservative Anabaptists such as the Conservative Mennonite churches and the Dunkard Brethren Church, headcovering is counted as an ordinance of the Church, being worn throughout the day by women. When Saint Paul commanded women to be veiled in 1 Corinthians (which was addressed to all Christians everywhere), the surrounding pagan Greek women did not wear headcoverings; as such, the practice of Christian headcovering was countercultural in the Apostolic Era, being a biblical ordinance rather than a cultural tradition. The style of headcoverings worn by Christian women varies by region, though the early Church's Apostolic Tradition specifies that Christian headcovering is to be observed with an "opaque cloth, not with a veil of thin linen".
