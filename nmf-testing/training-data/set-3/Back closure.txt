Back closure
||||||
A back closure is a means for fastening a garment at the rear, such as with a zipper, hooks-and-eyes or buttons.  Back closures were once common on Western female clothing, but have recently become less so, especially on female casual and business attire.  They continue, however, to be widely used in underwear (such as brassieres and garter belts), formal wear (such as evening gowns and wedding dresses) and specialized clothing (such as smocks).  Back closures are also common in garments for infants and toddlers.
