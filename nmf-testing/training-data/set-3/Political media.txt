Social media use in politics
||||||
Social media use in politics refers to the use of online social media platforms in political processes and activities. Political processes and activities include  all activities that pertain to the governance of a country or area. This includes political organization, global politics, political corruption, political parties, and political values.
The internet has created channels of communication that play a key role in circulating news, and social media has the power to change not just the message, but the dynamics of political corruption, values, and the dynamics of conflict in politics. Through the use of social media in election processes, global conflict, and extreme politics, diplomacy around the world has become less private and susceptive to the public perception.
