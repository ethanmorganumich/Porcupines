Canntaireachd (pronounced [ˈkʰãũn̪ˠt̪ɛɾʲəxk]; Scottish Gaelic for 'chanting') is the ancient method of teaching, learning and memorizing Piobaireachd (also spelt Pibroch), a type of music primarily played on the Great Highland bagpipe. In the canntairached method of instruction, the teacher sings or hums the tune to the pupil, sometimes using specific syllables which signify the sounds to be produced by the bagpipe.
