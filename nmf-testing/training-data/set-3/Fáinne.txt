Fáinne

Fáinne (Irish: [ˈfˠaːn̠ʲə]; pl. Fáinní but often Fáinnes in English) is the name of a pin badge worn to show fluency in, or a willingness to speak, the Irish Language.
The three modern versions of the pin as relaunched in 2014 by Conradh na Gaeilge are the Fáinne Óir (gold circle), Fáinne Mór Óir (large gold circle - 9ct) and Fáinne Airgid (silver circle).
In other contexts, fáinne simply means "ring" or "circle" and is also used to give terms such as: fáinne pósta (wedding ring), fáinne an lae (daybreak), Tiarna na bhFáinní (The Lord of the Rings), and fáinne cluaise (earring).
