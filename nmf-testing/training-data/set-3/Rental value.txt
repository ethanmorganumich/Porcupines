Rental value
||||||
Rental value is the fair market value of property while rented out in a lease.  More generally, it may be the consideration paid under the lease for the right to occupy, or the royalties or return received by a lessor (landlord) under a license to real property.  In the science and art of appraisal, it is the amount that would be paid for rental of similar real property in the same condition and in the same area.Determining Rental RatesDeciding on a rental rate doesn’t just mean figuring out the highest possible price you could list your rental for. Increasing the rental rate to the top of the market, can also increase the number of calls or issues a tenant may complain about during the term of the lease.
e.g. If you’re paying top dollar for something, you expect an exceptional experience. If you pay a below market rent, you are likely to not complain about smaller issues since you’re paying less.
Pricing your rental should be a strategy in order to maximize your net income. The longer you own the property, the easier this becomes.
