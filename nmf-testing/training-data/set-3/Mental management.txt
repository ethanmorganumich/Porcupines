mental management is a concept within the field of cognitive psychology that explores the cognitive, cerebral or thought-based processes in their different forms. Originally developed during the 1970s by French educator and philosopher Antoine de La Garanderie, mental management was developed in order for individuals to use their own mental activities and processes more effectively.
