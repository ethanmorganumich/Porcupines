The Italian garden (or giardino all'italiana (Italian pronunciation: [dʒarˈdiːno allitaˈljaːna]) is best known for a number of large Italian Renaissance gardens which have survived in something like their original form.  In the history of gardening, during the Renaissance, Italy had the most advanced and admired gardens in Europe, which greatly influenced other countries, especially the French formal garden and Dutch gardens and, mostly through these, gardens in Britain.  
The gardens were formally laid out, but probably in a somewhat more relaxed fashion than the later French style, aiming to extend or project the regularity of the architecture of the house into nature.   
From the late 18th century many grand Italian gardens were remade in a version of the English landscape garden style.
