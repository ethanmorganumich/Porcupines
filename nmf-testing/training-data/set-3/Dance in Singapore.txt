Dance in Singapore
||||||
Dance in Singapore comprises traditional and contemporary forms.  It has a relatively short history of creative, artistic and professional dance. The range of dance reflects the cultural diversity of Singapore. There is a consistent struggle between the rejection and acceptance of western dance influences and the re-emphasis of ethnic cultures from time to time.  The Singapore identity through dance is a challenging one often on an outward looking perception rather than the acceptance and recognition of indigenous/original creativity.  Notable non-profit artistic dance legacy include ECNAD and Arts Fission Company.
