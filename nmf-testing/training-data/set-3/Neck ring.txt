Neck ring
||||||
Neck rings, or neck-rings, are any form of stiff jewellery worn as an ornament around the neck of an individual, as opposed to a loose necklace. Many cultures and periods have made neck rings, with both males and females wearing them at various times.
Of the two most notable types is the torc, an often heavy and valuable ornament normally open at the throat.  These were worn by various early cultures but are especially associated with the ancient Celts of the European Iron Age, where they were evidently a key indicator of wealth and status, mostly worn by men.  
The other type is one or more spiral metal coils of many turns, often worn only by married women.
