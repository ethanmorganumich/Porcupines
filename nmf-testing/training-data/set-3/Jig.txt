Jig
||||||
The jig (Irish: port, Scottish Gaelic: port-cruinn) is a form of lively folk dance in compound metre, as well as the accompanying dance tune. It is most associated with Irish music and dance. It first gained popularity in 16th-century Ireland and parts of Great Britain and was quickly adopted on mainland Europe where it eventually became the final movement of the mature Baroque dance suite (the French gigue; Italian and Spanish giga). Today it is most associated with Irish dance music, Scottish country dance and the MÃ©tis people in Canada. Jigs were originally in duple compound metre, (e.g., 128 time), but have been adapted to a variety of time signatures, by which they are often classified into groups, including double jigs (68), slip jigs (98) and single jigs (128).
