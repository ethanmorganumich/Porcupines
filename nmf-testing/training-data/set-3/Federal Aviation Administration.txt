Powers over neighboring international waters were delegated to the FAA by authority of the International Civil Aviation Organization.
Created in August 1958 (1958-08), the FAA replaced the former Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) and later became an agency within the U.S. Department of Transportation.
