Music examination

Music examinations are a method of formally assessing the accomplishments of pupils learning musical instruments. These are called grades.
Although there are music examinations available to school and university students alongside other regular qualifications and assessments, there are also a number of independent bodies who solely provide assessment in musical ability which are open to all.
