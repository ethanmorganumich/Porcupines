Transimpedance amplifier

In electronics, a transimpedance amplifier (TIA) is a current to voltage converter, almost exclusively implemented with one or more operational amplifiers. The TIA can be used to amplify the current output of Geiger–Müller tubes, photo multiplier tubes, accelerometers, photo detectors and other types of sensors to a usable voltage.    Current to voltage converters are used with sensors that have a current response that is more linear than the voltage response.   This is the case with photodiodes where it is not uncommon for the current response to have better than 1% nonlinearity over a wide range of light input. The transimpedance amplifier presents a low impedance to the photodiode and isolates it from the output voltage of the operational amplifier.   In its simplest form a transimpedance amplifier has just a large valued feedback resistor, Rf.   The gain of the amplifer is set by this resistor and because the amplifier is in an inverting configuration, has a value of -Rf.  There are several different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers, each suited to a particular application.   The one factor they all have in common is the requirement to convert the low-level current of a sensor to a voltage.   The gain, bandwidth, as well as current and voltage offsets change with different types of sensors, requiring different configurations of transimpedance amplifiers.
