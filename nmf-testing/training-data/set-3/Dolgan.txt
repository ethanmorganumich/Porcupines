Dolgans (Russian: Долганы; Dolgan: Долган, Дулҕан  Dulğan, Һака (Sakha); Yakut: тыа-киһи) are an ethnic group who mostly inhabit Krasnoyarsk Krai, Russia. They are descended from several groups, particularly Evenks, one of the indigenous peoples of the Russian North. They adopted a Turkic language sometime after the 18th century. The 2010 Census counted 7,885 Dolgans. This number includes 5,517 in former Taymyr Autonomous Okrug.
Dolgans speak the Dolgan language, which is closely related to the Yakut language.
