In jewelry, a collar is an ornament for the neck.
Collar is an older word for necklace, and is usually reserved today for a necklace that lies flat to the body rather than hanging freely and rests directly above the collar bone.
In contemporary fine jewelry, collar necklaces are 14 inches in chain length and look similar to a collar on a shirt. In street fashion, collars are more commonly referred to as dog collars. Dog collars are associated with the punk scene and the BDSM scene.Specifically, collar may refer to:
