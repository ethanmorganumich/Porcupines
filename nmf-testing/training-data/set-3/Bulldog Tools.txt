Bulldog Tools is a British manufacturer of gardening and agricultural tools based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England. The company was founded by William & Henry Parkes, and established in 1780 at the Clarington Forge site in Ince in Makerfield, near Wigan, then in Lancashire. Bulldog Tools is one of the oldest businesses still existing in the Wigan area today, still producing products on the same factory site as originally intended. Bulldog spades were deployed by the British during WW1 to dig trenches and are still issued in the British military today. Today it is owned by the Rollins Group based in Harlow in Essex who acquired Bulldog Tools in 2004.
