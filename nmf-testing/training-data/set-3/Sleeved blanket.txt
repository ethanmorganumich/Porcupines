Sleeved blanket
||||||
A sleeved blanket is a body-length blanket with sleeves usually made of fleece or nylon material. It is similar in design to a bathrobe but is meant to be worn backwards (i.e., with the opening in the back). The product has been marketed by various brands but the Original company was  'Slanket' created by Gary Clegg then other companies like Snuggie, Snuggler, Doojo, Toasty Wrap, copying the brand later. It comes with varying sizes, colors and qualities of materials but similar basic design.
