Private defense agency
||||||
A private defense agency (PDA) is a theoretical enterprise which would provide personal protection and military defense services to individuals who would pay for its services. PDAs are advocated in anarcho-capitalism as a way of enforcing the system of private property.A PDA is distinguished from a private contractor employed by a state which is usually subsidized. Instead, such agencies would in theory be voluntarily financed primarily by competing insurance and security companies.
