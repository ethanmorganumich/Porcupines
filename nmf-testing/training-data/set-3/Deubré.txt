Deubré
||||||
Deubré is a generic term, originating at Nike, Inc. and dating from the mid 1990s, for an ornamental shoelace tag, most commonly seen on sneakers.  Typically, a deubré will have two holes through which a shoelace is threaded, like a bead on string. When the shoe is laced, the deubré is centered between the first two eyelets (closest to the toe), with the shoelace passing through and behind the deubré.  
A deubré is typically made of metal, plastic, or leather, and may often be decorated with text or a commercial logo.  It is distinguished from a bead in that it is non-tubular; it has two points of entry/exit for the shoelace, as a belt or webbing may pass through a buckle.  Although primarily decorative in purpose, one could argue a deubré is also functional in that once threaded to the midpoint of a shoelace, it assists in centering the shoelace in the shoe, although few deubré and shoelace combinations will necessarily provide enough friction to hold the deubré in place while lacing.
