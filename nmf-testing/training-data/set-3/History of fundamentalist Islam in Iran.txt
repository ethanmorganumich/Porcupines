Islamic fundamentalism in Iran
||||||
The history of Islamic fundamentalism in Iran covers the historical development of Islamic fundamentalism, Islamism, Islamic revivalism, and the rise of political Islam in modern Iran. Today, there are basically three types of Islam in Iran: traditionalism, modernism, and a variety of forms of revivalism usually brought together as fundamentalism. Neo-fundamentalists in Iran are a subgroup of fundamentalists who have also borrowed from Western countercurrents of populism, fascism, anarchism, Jacobinism, and Marxism. The term "Principlists" or Osoulgarayan, is an umbrella term commonly used in Iranian politics to refer to a variety of conservative circles and parties. The term contrasts with reformists or Eslaah-Talabaan, who seek religious and constitutional reforms in Iran.
