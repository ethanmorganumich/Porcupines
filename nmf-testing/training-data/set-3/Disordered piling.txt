Disordered piling
||||||
Disordered piling (乱石積, ransekizumi) is a Japanese wall-building technique consisting of large number of small stones packed tightly together. It was used in some Japanese castle walls to create a wall that was difficult to climb. As it became more sophisticated it evolved into a technique known as burdock piling.
