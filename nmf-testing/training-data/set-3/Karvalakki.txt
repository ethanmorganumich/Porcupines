Karvalakki
||||||
A karvalakki (Finnish: furry cap) is a cylinder-shaped, furry forage cap-styled hat typically worn in parts of Finland and Russia. Finnish TV presenter Hannu Karpo often wore a karvalakki on his show, Karpolla on asiaa.
In Finnish, the expression karvalakkimalli ("furry cap model") means a bare-bones, no-frills model, meaning the cheapest and most basic model that just works and does nothing extra. The term can also be used to describe anything that is very basic.
