Vocal pedagogy is the study of the art and science of voice instruction. It is used in the teaching of singing and assists in defining what singing is, how singing works, and how proper singing technique is accomplished.
Vocal pedagogy covers a broad range of aspects of singing, ranging from the physiological process of vocal production to the artistic aspects of interpretation of songs from different genres or historical eras. Typical areas of study include:
Human anatomy and physiology as it relates to the physical process of singing.
Breathing and air support for singing
Posture for singing
Phonation
Vocal resonation or voice projection
Diction, vowels and articulation
Vocal registration
Sostenuto and legato for singing
Other singing elements, such as range extension, tone quality, vibrato, coloratura
Vocal health and voice disorders related to singing
Vocal styles, such as learning to sing opera, belt, or art song
Phonetics
Voice classificationAll of these different concepts are a part of developing proper vocal technique. Not all voice teachers have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique.
