Experience Economy
||||||
The Experience Economy is the sale of memorable experiences to customers. The term  was first used in a 1998 article by B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore describing the next economy following the agrarian economy, the industrial economy, and the most recent service economy.  The concept had been previously researched by many authors.
Pine and Gilmore argue that businesses must orchestrate memorable events for their customers, and that memory itself becomes the product: the "experience". More advanced experience businesses can begin charging for the value of the "transformation" that an experience offers, e.g., as education offerings might do if they were able to participate in the value that is created by the educated individual. This, they argue, is a natural progression in the value added by the business over and above its inputs.Although the concept of the experience economy was initially focused in business, it has crossed into tourism, architecture, nursing, urban planning and other fields.
The Experience Economy is also considered the main underpinning for customer experience management.
