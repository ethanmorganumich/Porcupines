A nightgown, nightie or nightdress is a loosely hanging item of nightwear, and is commonly worn by women and girls. A nightgown is made from cotton, silk, satin, or nylon and may be decorated with lace appliqu√©s or embroidery at the bust and hem.A nightgown may have any neckline, and may have sleeves of any type, or be sleeveless, and any shoulder strap or back style. The length of a nightgown may vary from hip-length to floor-length. A short nightgown can be called a "shortie" or a "babydoll", depending on the style. The sweep (taper from top to bottom) of the night gown can vary from virtually straight, to full circle sweep, like the Olga gown. A slip nightgown may be used as a nightgown or as a full slip. Nightgowns may be worn with a matching outer garment such as a robe, a sheer chiffon peignoir, or a dressing gown, to make them appropriate for receiving guests.
