Brown patch
||||||
Brown patch is a common turfgrass fungal disease that is caused by species in the genus Rhizoctonia, usually Rhizoctonia solani. Brown patch can be found in all of the cool season turfgrasses found in the United States. Brown patch is most devastating to: Bentgrass (Agrostis sp.), ryegrass (Lolium sp.), Annual bluegrass (Poa annua), and Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea).  Brown patch is also found in Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis) and Fine fescue (Festuca sp.) but this is rare or does minimal damage. Brown patch is known as a foliar disease, so it does not have any effect on the crown or roots of the turf plant.
