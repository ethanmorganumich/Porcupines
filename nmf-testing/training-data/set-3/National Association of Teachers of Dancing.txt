||||||
The National Association of Teachers of Dancing promotes dance, and provides services to its members. 
Founded in 1906, by 1912 it had 50 members; today the membership numbers around 2000. It was originally devoted to set and sequence dancing based on the five positions of the ballet. Now it is organised into a Theatre Branch and a Ballroom Branch, and is a member of the British Dance Council, the Central Council of Physical Recreation, the Council for Dance Education and Training and the International Stage Dance Council.
Although described as 'national', the association is international with a worldwide membership in 26 countries. Examiners regularly travel as far afield as Canada, Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong.
