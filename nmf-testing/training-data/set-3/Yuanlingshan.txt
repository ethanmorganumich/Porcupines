Yuanlingshan (Chinese: 圓領衫; pinyin: yuánlǐngshān; lit. 'round collar jacket') is a form of round-collared upper garment (called shan) in Hanfu; it is also referred as yuanlingpao  (Chinese: 圓領袍; pinyin: yuánlǐngpáo; lit. 'round collar gown/robe') or panlingpao (Chinese: 盤領袍; pinyin: pánlǐngpáo) when used as a robe (called paofu: 17 ). The yuanlingshan and yuanlingpao were both developed under the influence of Hufu from the Donghu people in the early Han dynasty and later on by the Wuhu (including the Xianbei people) in the Six dynasties period. The yuanlingpao is a formal attire usually worn by men, though it was also fashionable for women to wear it in some dynasties, such as in the Tang dynasty. In the Tang dynasty, the yuanlingpao could also transform into the fanlingpao.There are also specific forms of yuanlingpao and yuanlingshan which are named based on its decorations and construction; for example, the panling lanshan (Chinese: 盤領襴衫), also called lanshan (Chinese: 襴衫) for short, bufu,: 185–186  wulingshan (Chinese: 無領衫; lit. 'collarless shirt'), longpao (Chinese: 龍袍; lit. 'dragon robe'), and mangfu (Chinese: 蟒服; lit. 'python clothing').
