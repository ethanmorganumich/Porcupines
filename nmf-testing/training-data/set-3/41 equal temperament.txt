41 equal temperament
||||||
In music, 41 equal temperament, abbreviated 41-TET, 41-EDO, or 41-ET, is the tempered scale derived by dividing the octave into 41 equally sized steps (equal frequency ratios). Play  Each step represents a frequency ratio of 21/41, or 29.27 cents (Play ), an interval close in size to the septimal comma.  41-ET can be seen as a tuning of the schismatic, magic and miracle temperaments.  It is the second smallest equal temperament, after 29-ET, whose perfect fifth is closer to just intonation than that of 12-ET. In other words,
