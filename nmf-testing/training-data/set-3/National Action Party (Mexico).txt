National Action Party (Mexico)

The National Action Party (Spanish: Partido Acción Nacional, PAN) is a conservative political party in Mexico founded in 1939. The party is one of the four main political parties in Mexico, and, since the 1980s, has had success winning local, state, and national elections.
In the historic 2000 Mexican general election, PAN candidate Vicente Fox was elected president for the constitutional six-year term; his victory marked the first time in 71 years that the Mexican presidency was not held by a member of the traditional ruling party, the PRI. Six years later, PAN candidate Felipe Calderón succeeded Fox in the presidency following victory in the 2006 presidential election. During the period 2000–2012, PAN was the strongest party in both houses of the Congress of the Union (the federal legislature) but lacked a majority in either house. In the 2006 legislative elections the party won 207 out of 500 seats in the Chamber of Deputies and 52 out of 128 Senators. In the 2012 legislative elections, PAN won 38 seats in the Senate, and 114 seats in the Chamber of Deputies, although the party did not win the presidential election in either 2012 nor in 2018. The members of this party are colloquially called Panistas.
Notoriously, the two Presidents of the Republic that were elected as PAN candidates (Vicente Fox and Felipe Calderón) have both left the party. Fox supported PRI presidential candidates in 2012 and 2018, while Calderón has founded his own party, named "México Libre".
