Non-dance
||||||
Non-dance is a choreographic movement within contemporary dance. It began in the 1990, principally in France. Its practitioners see it as a transdisciplinary movement, dispensing with the movement vocabulary of traditional dance to integrate or substitute that of other performing arts (theater, video, music, and plastic arts).
