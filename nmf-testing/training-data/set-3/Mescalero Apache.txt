Mescalero or Mescalero Apache (Mescalero-Chiricahua: Naa'dahéńdé) is an Apache tribe of Southern Athabaskan–speaking Native Americans. The tribe is federally recognized as the Mescalero Apache Tribe of the Mescalero Apache Reservation, located in south-central New Mexico.     
In the 19th century, the Mescalero opened their reservation to other Apache tribes, such as the Mimbreno (Chíhéńde, Warm Springs Apaches) and the Chiricahua (Shá'i'á-ńde or Chidikáágu).   Some Lipan Apache (Tú 'édì-néńde and Tú ntsaa-ńde) also joined the reservation. Their descendants are enrolled in the Mescalero Apache Tribe.
