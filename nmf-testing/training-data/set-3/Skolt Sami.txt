Skolt Sámi (sääʹmǩiõll [ɕa̟ːmʰc͡çjɘhlː], "the Sámi language", or nuõrttsääʹmǩiõll [nwɘrʰtːɕa̟ːmʰc͡çjɘhlː], "the Eastern Sámi language", if a distinction needs to be made between it and the other Sámi languages) is a Uralic, Sámi language that is spoken by the Skolts, with approximately 300 speakers in Finland, mainly in Sevettijärvi and approximately 20–30 speakers of the Njuõʹttjäuʹrr (Notozero) dialect in an area surrounding Lake Lovozero in Russia. Skolt Sámi also used to be spoken in the Neiden area of Norway. It is written using a modified Roman orthography which was made official in 1973.
The term Skolt was coined by representatives of the majority culture and has negative connotation which can be compared to the term Lapp. Nevertheless, it is used in cultural and linguistic studies.
