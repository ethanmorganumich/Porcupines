Architecture of Goan Catholics
||||||
The architecture of Goan Catholics has strong Portuguese and native Goan influences. It developed over the Portuguese India era (1500sâ€“1961).
Many of the 16th and 17th colonial Catholic churches were built in the Portuguese Baroque style. Most of the historic houses still standing were built between the 18th century and the early part of the 20th century, in a mix of Neoclassical and Gothic Revival styles.
