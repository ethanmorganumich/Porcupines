Refuse/Resist is Sepultura's fourth single, released in 1993. The title song, also included as a single off the album Chaos A.D., is one of the band's best-known songs and remains a concert staple to this day. A music video was filmed for the single which features the band playing live at a festival intercut with footage of rioting and general unrest. This video can be found on the VHS Third World Chaos, which was later released on DVD as part of the Chaos DVD. The intro to the song is the heartbeat of Max Cavalera's then-unborn first son Zyon. This song is also notable for having a 20-second growl at the end."Refuse/Resist" also appears in live form on the band's live releases Under a Pale Grey Sky and Live in SÃ£o Paulo.
