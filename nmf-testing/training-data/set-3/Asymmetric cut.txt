Asymmetric cut
||||||
An asymmetric cut is a haircut in which the hair is cut in such a way that the hair does not have left-right symmetry and one side is cut or appears to be longer than the other. It is a versatile hairstyle with many subvariations. Usually it is a combination of two separate styles, one for each side. An extreme variation is the "side shave", in which one side of the head is totally or partially shaved close.
