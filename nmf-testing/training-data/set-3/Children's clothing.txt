Children's clothing or kids' clothing is clothing for children who have not yet grown to full height.  Children's clothing is often more casual than adult clothing, fit for play and rest.
In the early 21st century, however, childrenswear became heavily influenced by trends in adult fashion. Grandma bait is a retail industry term for expensive children's clothing.  Due to the rise of social media platforms such as Instagram, celebrities and fashion bloggers have been using their accounts to post pictures of their children wearing luxury "street style" clothing, thus inspiring parents to dress their children as they would dress themselves. Good quality, well-designed garments are a priority for some parents, and children's clothing is getting a prime place in top-label stores and high-end fashion retail outlets. Clothes are also getting separately designed for boys and girls at a very early age.
