Rimless eyeglasses
||||||
Rimless eyeglasses are a type of eyeglasses in which the lenses are mounted directly to the bridge and/or temples. The style is divided into two subtypes: three-piece glasses are composed of lenses mounted to a bridge and two separate temple arms, while rimways (also called cortlands) feature a supporting arch that connects the temples to the bridge and provides extra stability for the lenses.
Rimless glasses were a popular style of eyeglasses from the 1880s until into the 1960s, and re-emerged in popularity in the latter part of the 20th century and early 21st century. Apple founder and former CEO Steve Jobs wore round rimless eyeglasses for 18 years, from 1993 until his death in 2011. 
Despite these shifts, they are unique among eyeglass styles in that they have never gone completely out of fashion, remaining an acceptable alternative through the years to more stylish designs.
