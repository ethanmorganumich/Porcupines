Yếm
||||||
A yếm or áo yếm  (Vietnamese: [ʔiə̌m], Chữ Hán: 兜子 đâu tử, Chữ Nôm: 裺 hoặc 𧞣) is a traditional Vietnamese undergarment that was once worn by Vietnamese women across all classes.  It was most usually worn underneath a blouse or mantle to preserve modesty.
It is a simple garment with many variations from its basic form, which is a simple, usually diamond or square-cut piece of cloth draped over a woman's chest with strings to tie at the neck and back.
