Huabiao
||||||
Huabiao (simplified Chinese: 华表; traditional Chinese: 華表; pinyin: huábiǎo; Jyutping: waa4 biu2; Pe̍h-ōe-jī: hôa-piáu) is a type of ceremonial column used in traditional Chinese architecture. Huabiao are traditionally erected in pairs in front of palaces and tombs. The prominence of their placement have made them one of the emblems of traditional Chinese culture. When placed outside palaces, they can also be called bangmu (simplified Chinese: 谤木; traditional Chinese: 謗木; pinyin: Bàng mù; lit. 'commentary board'). When placed outside a tomb, they can also be called shendaozhu (Chinese: 神道柱; pinyin: Shéndào zhù; lit. 'spirit way columns').
