French formal garden
||||||
The French formal garden, also called the jardin à la française (French for 'garden in the French manner'), is a style of garden based on symmetry and the principle of imposing order on nature. Its epitome is generally considered to be the Gardens of Versailles designed during the 17th century by the landscape architect André Le Nôtre for Louis XIV and widely copied by other European courts.
