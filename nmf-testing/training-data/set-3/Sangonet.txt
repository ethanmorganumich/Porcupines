SANGONeT is a South African organisation, whose acronym stands for The Southern African NGO Network.
It is a civil society organisation with a focus on ICT, which was founded in 1987, and has a history closely linked to the social and political changes experienced by South Africa during its transition to democracy.
In 2006, SANGONeT launched a new joint venture, called www.sangotech.org whose aim is to "meet and respond to the South African NGO sector's connectivity, hardware and e-business infrastructure * requirements."
