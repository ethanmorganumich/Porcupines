It indicates the status of the station and may indicate its geographical area. The following factors are reflected in routing indicator assignment:

(a) National or international affiliation and service (when required) of the station.
(b) The geographical area in which the station is located or area from which it is served.
(c) Network status of the station, i.e., major or minor relay, or tributary stations.Routing indicators consist of not less than four, and not more than seven

In conjunction with the second letter “J”, may be reallocated, on a national basis, to a country not listed.Fourth Letter - This letter position serves a dual purpose as follows:Indicates major relay stations, as generated by assignment requirements.
