Cotton duck
||||||
Cotton duck (from Dutch: doek, "linen canvas"), also simply duck, sometimes duck cloth or duck canvas, is a heavy, plain woven cotton fabric.   Duck canvas is more tightly woven than plain canvas. There is also linen duck, which is less often used.
Cotton duck is used in a wide range of applications, from sneakers to painting canvases to tents to sandbags.Duck fabric is woven with two yarns together in the warp and a single yarn in the weft.
By treating with wax, duck fabric can be made waterproof (see waxed cotton).  
Cotton duck strips were the origin of duck tape, recorded in the Oxford English Dictionary as having been in use since 1899 (see duct tape).
