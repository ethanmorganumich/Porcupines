Boston Fashion Week
||||||
Boston Fashion Week is a week-long luxury clothing event that takes place annually in Boston, United States. Fashion Week allows for international and local designers to showcase their creations to the general public, buyers, celebrities, and fashion experts.  The event was established in the city by Jay Calderin in 1995. It faced a few setbacks in the early years, but is now increasing its popularity and importance, as Boston becomes a more fashion forward city. Accessibility and diversity in programming allow the public to engage the week on many levels; experiencing a show, taking in an exhibit, participating in an educational program or joining in the festivities at a party. The week also contributes to a sense of civic pride about what the region has to offer and how it continues to evolve.
