New Formalism (architecture)
||||||
New Formalism is an architectural style that emerged in the United States during the mid-1950s and flowered in the 1960s. Buildings designed in that style exhibited many Classical elements including "strict symmetrical elevations" building proportion and scale, Classical columns, highly stylized entablatures and colonnades. The style was used primarily for high-profile cultural, institutional and civic buildings. Edward Durrell Stone's New Delhi American Embassy (1954), which blended the architecture of the east with modern western concepts, is considered to be the symbolic start of New Formalism architecture.Common features of the New Formalism style include:

Use of traditionally rich materials such as travertine, marble, and granite or man-made materials that mimic their luxurious qualities

Designed to achieve modern monumentality
Embraces classical precedents, such as arches, colonnades, classical columns and entablatures
