A money bag (or money sack) is a bag normally used to hold and transport coins and banknotes, often closed with a drawstring. When transported between banks and other institutions, money bags are usually moved in an armored car or a money train.  It is a type of currency packaging.  The money bag has had great success in cartoons and other light popular culture.
