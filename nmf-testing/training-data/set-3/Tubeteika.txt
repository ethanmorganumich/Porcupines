Tubeteika
||||||
A tubeteika (Russian: тюбете́йка, tr. tyubeteika, IPA: [tʲʉbʲɪˈtʲeɪ̯kə] (listen)) is a Russian word for many varieties of traditional Central Asian caps. Tubeteikas are today worn in Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan, as well as in Muslim-populated regions of Russia (mainly Tatars) and Azerbaijan. The skullcap worn by Uzbeks and Uyghurs is called a doppa and has a square base. It was a popular headgear among children throughout the USSR during the 1940s and 1950s.  
Tubeteikas are worn typically by the Turkic ethnic groups of the region. It bears some superficial resemblance to the yurt, another Central Asian cultural icon.
The -ka at the end is a Russian diminutive suffix, as with shapka, ushanka and budenovka. In Turkmen, it is called tahiya ("taqiyah").
