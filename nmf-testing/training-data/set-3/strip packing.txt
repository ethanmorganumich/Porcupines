Strip packing problem
||||||
The strip packing problem is a 2-dimensional geometric minimization problem. 
Given a set of axis-aligned rectangles and a strip of bounded width and infinite height, determine an overlapping-free packing of the rectangles into the strip minimizing its height. 
This problem is a cutting and packing problem and is classified as an Open Dimension Problem according to Wäscher et al.This problem arises in the area of scheduling, where it models jobs, that require a contiguous portion of the memory over a given time period. Another example is the area of industrial manufacturing, where rectangular pieces need to be cut out of a sheet of material (e.g., cloth or paper) that has a fixed width but infinite length, and one wants to minimize the wasted material.
This problem was first studied in 1980. It is strongly-NP hard and there exists no polynomial time approximation algorithm with a ratio smaller than

  , imposing an open question whether there is an algorithm with approximation ratio
