School uniforms in Malaysia
||||||
In Malaysia, school uniforms are compulsory for all students who attend public schools. School uniforms are almost universal in the public and private school systems.
Western-style school uniforms were first introduced to Malaysia in the 19th century. Since 1970, uniforms have been made compulsory for all students throughout the whole country. 
For public schools, uniforms are almost completely standardised throughout the country, with the only differentiating factor being the school badge.
Private schools usually have a wider range of school uniform designs.
