The Manila shawl (Spanish: mantón de Manila or mantón de seda)  is an embroidered silk shawl derived from the Filipino pañuelo. They were popular in the Philippines, Latin America and Spain during the colonial era. It also became popular in European fashions in the 19th century. In modern times, it is still an aspect in various traditional clothing in Hispanic cultures, and is particularly prominent as part of the costume (traje de flamenca) of flamenco dancers (bailaoras) and Gitana women.
