Louis Philippe style
||||||
The style of architecture and design under King Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) was a more eclectic development of French neoclassicism, incorporating elements of neo-Gothic and other styles.  It was the first French decorative style imposed not by royalty, but by the tastes of the growing French upper class. In painting, neoclassicism and romanticism contended to become the dominant style. In literature and music, France had a golden age, as the home of Frédéric Chopin, Franz Liszt, Victor Hugo, Honoré de Balzac, and other major poets and artists.
Much of the style was taken from the personality of the King himself.  Unlike his Bourbon predecessors, he wore business dress, not formal robes, he lived in Paris, and he shunned ceremonies; he carried his own umbrella, and imposed no official styles.
Louis Philippe furniture had the same types and forms as the earlier French Restoration style, but with less decoration;  comfort was the primary consideration.  The Louis Philippe commode, with a marble top and a marquetry covering, was a popular example of the style.
