Architectural geometry
||||||
Architectural geometry is an area of research which combines applied geometry and architecture, which looks at the design, analysis and manufacture processes. It lies at the core of architectural design and strongly challenges contemporary practice, the so-called architectural practice of the digital age.Architectural geometry is influenced by following fields: differential geometry, topology, fractal geometry, and cellular automata.

Topics include:

freeform curves and surfaces creation
developable surfaces
discretisation
generative design
digital prototyping and manufacturing
