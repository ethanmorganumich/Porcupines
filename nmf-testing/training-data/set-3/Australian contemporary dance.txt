Contemporary dance in Australia is diverse with dance companies performing a broad range of what elsewhere may be termed contemporary and modern dance styles.
The two largest companies are Sydney Dance Company and Bangarra Dance Theatre, both based in Sydney and touring nationally. Other notable contemporary dance companies based in different parts of Australia include Australian Dance Theatre, Chunky Move and Dancenorth. 
Contemporary arts centres like Arts House in Melbourne and Carriageworks in Sydney regularly feature contemporary dance in their programs. Major performing arts festivals, like the Adelaide Festival, Sydney Festival and Perth Festival, often commission and present contemporary dance. Contemporary dance-specific festivals include Dance Massive in Melbourne.
Most companies work on a project basis with artists contracted for a set period of time, ranging from days to months, with no guarantee of further employment. Other funding sources include project specific funding for a dance work by example by a festival or performance venue to raise the expenses required to bring it to fruition.
