Extreme point
||||||
In mathematics, an extreme point of a convex set 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   in a real or complex vector space is a point in 
  
    
      
        S
      
    
    {\displaystyle S}
   which does not lie in any open line segment joining two points of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
   In linear programming problems, an extreme point is also called vertex or corner point of 
  
    
      
        S
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle S.}
