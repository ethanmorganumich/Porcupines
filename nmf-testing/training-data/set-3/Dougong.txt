Dougong
||||||
Dougong (Chinese: 斗拱; pinyin: dǒugǒng; lit. 'cap [and] block')  is a structural element of interlocking wooden brackets, one of the most important in traditional Chinese architecture.
The use of dougong first appeared in buildings of the late centuries BC and evolved into a structural network that joined pillars and columns to the frame of the roof. Dougong was widely used by the ancient Chinese during the Spring and Autumn period (770–476 BC) and developed into a complex set of interlocking parts by its peak in the Tang and Song periods. The pieces are fitted together by joinery alone without glue or fasteners, requiring precise carpentry.
After the Song Dynasty, brackets and bracket sets used in palatial structures and important religious buildings became more ornamental than structural, no longer fitting the description of traditional dougong.
