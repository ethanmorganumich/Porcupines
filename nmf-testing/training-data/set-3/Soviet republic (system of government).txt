Soviet republic (system of government)
||||||
A soviet republic (from Russian: Советская республика, tr. Sovetskaya respublika) is a republic in which the government is formed of soviets (workers' councils) and politics are based on soviet democracy.
Although the term is usually associated with Soviet member-states, it was not initially used to represent the political organisation of the Soviet Union, but merely a form of democracy.
There were several revolutionary workers' movements in various areas of Europe which declared independence under the name of a soviet republic in the immediate aftermath of the First World War.
