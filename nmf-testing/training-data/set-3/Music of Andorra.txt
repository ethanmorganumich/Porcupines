The Principality of Andorra is home to folk dances like the contrapàs and marratxa, which survive in Sant Julià de Lòria especially. Andorran folk music has similarities to the music in nearby regions of France and Spain, but is especially Catalan in character, especially in the presence of dances like the sardana. Other Andorran folk dances include contrapàs in Andorra la Vella and Saint Anne's dance in Escaldes-Engordany.Radio Nacional d’Andorra runs both Radio Andorra and the music station Andorra Música.
Music festivals in Andorra include the ChamJam Music Festival, Ordino and the jazz Escaldes-Engordany International Jazz Festival. Violinist Gérard Claret is the director of the Young National Orchestra of Cambra d'Andorra.
