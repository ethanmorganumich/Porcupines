Palestine Media Watch

Palestine Media Watch (PMWATCH) was an organization established in October 2000 that monitored the U.S. mainstream media's coverage of the Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict and mobilized against what it deemed to be anti-Palestinian or pro-Israel bias in the coverage of the conflict. The organization focused mainly on issuing letter-writing action calls and publishing reports analyzing coverage. According to the group's founder,  Ahmed Bouzid,  "There's a paradigm we're trying to change: that Israelis are defending themselves and the Palestinians are attacking, and when the Israelis do something it must be a mistake or an act of self-defense." The organization's website has not been active since about 2009. The organization was the subject of a PhD dissertation by Robert Lyle Handley from the University of Texas, Austin, titled, "Palestine Media Watch and the U.S. News Media: Strategies for Change and Resistance."
