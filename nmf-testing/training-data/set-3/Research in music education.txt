There are many published examples of research in music education, using a variety of approaches including surveys, experiments, and historical studies. In the United States, research in this field has been carried out for many years under the auspices of the National Association for Music Education (NAfME, formerly MENC). There are a number of books about music education research, and several journals are devoted to reports of research in this field.
