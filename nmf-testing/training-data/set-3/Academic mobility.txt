Academic mobility
||||||
Academic mobility refers to students and teachers in higher education moving to another institution inside or outside of their own country to study or teach for a limited time.
The Bologna process regulates academic mobility within European higher education area.
Mobile students are usually divided into two groups: Free-movers are students who travel entirely on their own initiative, while programme students use exchange programmes at a department, faculty, institution, or national level (such as Erasmus, Nordplus or Fulbright). Nowadays, the traditional Erasmus exchange (which involves travelling) has been complemented with virtual mobility, or Virtual Erasmus, in which students from different countries may study together without leaving their home.
