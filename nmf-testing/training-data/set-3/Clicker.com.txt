Clicker was an Internet video directory and search company based in Los Angeles, California.  Their website aimed to be the TV Guide for all full episodes of programs available to watch on the Web. It is owned by CBS Interactive.
Clicker indexed only legal video that is streamable online.  It did not host any content, instead focusing on helping users discover and navigate to professional content hosted by rights-holders. While much of the streaming video content Clicker indexes was available for free, Clicker also pointed to paid services like Amazon Video-on-Demand, iTunes and Netflix Watch Instantly. Clicker also began indexing Comcast Xfinity, Comcast's online library of TV shows and movies, in August 2010.In addition to search and directory services, Clicker offered DVR-like features that enabled users to subscribe to shows and track when programs became available online.  Additionally, Clicker offered many social features for sharing programming information on Facebook pages and Twitter.  In July 2010, Clicker launched Clicker Social, which brought social discovery to the online television guide and let users share what they were watching, follow their friends, recommend shows and movies, and earn awards from content partners like HBO, PBS, Showtime, Crackle, Revision3, Snag Films, NCAA Vault and more.In April, Clicker launched its iPad Edition. Users who visit the site from their iPad will be automatically redirected to a special version of Clicker that provides a complete programming guide for the iPad, making it easy for iPad users to find what broadcast-quality programming is available to watch and what's not. Clicker also has mobile apps for the iPhone and Android devices which let users check-in to share what they're watching, find programming to watch on their phone, and manage their Playlist.
