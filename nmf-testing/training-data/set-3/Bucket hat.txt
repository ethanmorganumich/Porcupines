Bucket hat
||||||
A bucket hat (variations of which include the fisherman's hat, Irish country hat and session hat) is a hat with a narrow, downward-sloping brim.  Typically, the hat is made from heavy-duty cotton fabric such as denim or canvas, or heavy wool such as tweed, sometimes with metal eyelets placed on the crown of the hat for ventilation.
It was first adopted as a high fashion item in the 1960s, and with subsequent revivals in both street fashion and on the catwalk. It is popular festival gear in the present day, also known as a "session hat" and is favored by fans of bands such as Sticky Fingers, The Stone Roses, King Gizzard & the Lizard Wizard, Oasis, Yung Lean, and The Courteeners.
