Kaosikii dance
||||||
The Kaosikii or Kaos'ikii dance is a dance invented on September 6, 1978 by the Indian philosopher and social reformer Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar aka Shrii Shrii Anandamurti (1921–1990).Sarkar claims the kaos'ikii dance is a psycho-physical exercise which would benefit the mind by developing mental stamina and strength. Some hints to this dance are also contained in the speech "The Cosmic Father Has a Special Responsibility" given in Madras (India) on December 4, 1978 and later published in "Ánanda Vacanámrtam Part 6, Chapter 5" and "Discourses on Tantra Volume Two, Chapter 23".
