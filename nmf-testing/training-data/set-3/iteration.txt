Iteration
||||||
Iteration is the repetition of a process in order to generate a (possibly unbounded) sequence of outcomes. Each repetition of the process is a single iteration, and the outcome of each iteration is then the starting point of the next iteration. 
In mathematics and computer science, iteration (along with the related technique of recursion) is a standard element of algorithms.
