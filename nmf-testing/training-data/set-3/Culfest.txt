Cultural festival (India)
||||||
In India, a cultural festival, cultfest, culfest or college fest is an annual cultural event at a college or university organised by the student community, involving participants from other colleges as well. Professional performing artists are also typically invited, and a number of competitions are held for students. Fests are usually funded through sponsors, although some colleges have begun exploring the idea of crowdfunding.
