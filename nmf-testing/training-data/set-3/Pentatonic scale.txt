Pentatonic scale
||||||
A pentatonic scale is a musical scale with five notes per octave, in contrast to the heptatonic scale, which has seven notes per octave (such as the major scale and minor scale).
Pentatonic scales were developed independently by many ancient civilizations and are still used in various musical styles to this day.
There are two types of pentatonic scales: those with semitones (hemitonic) and those without (anhemitonic).
