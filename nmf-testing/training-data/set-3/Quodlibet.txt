Quodlibet
||||||
A quodlibet (; Latin for "whatever you wish" from quod, "what" and libet, "pleases") is a musical composition that combines several different melodies—usually popular tunes—in counterpoint, and often in a light-hearted, humorous manner.
There are three main types of quodlibet:

A catalogue quodlibet consists of a free setting of catalogue poetry (usually humorous lists of loosely related items).
In a successive quodlibet, one voice has short musical quotations and textual quotations while the other voices provide homophonic accompaniment.
In a simultaneous quodlibet, two or more pre-existing melodies are combined. The simultaneous quodlibet may be considered a historical antecedent to the modern-day musical mashup.
