Layered hair
||||||
Layered hair is a hairstyle that gives the illusion of length and volume using long hair for the illusion of length and short hair for volume, as an easy style to manage. Hair is arranged into layers, with the top layers (those that grow nearer the crown) cut shorter than the layers beneath. This allows the tips of the top layers to blend seamlessly with layers beneath.
Popular modern hairstyles involve creating unique styles between the different layers. There can be distinct layering with obvious layers, or blended layering with soft layers.  Hair color can also amplify the layering effect that layers give in a certain hair style.
