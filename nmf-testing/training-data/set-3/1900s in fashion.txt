1900s in Western fashion
||||||
Fashion in the period 1900â€“1909 in the Western world continued the severe, long and elegant lines of the late 1890s.  Tall, stiff collars characterize the period, as do women's broad hats and full "Gibson Girl" hairstyles.  A new, columnar silhouette introduced by the couturiers of Paris late in the decade signaled the approaching abandonment of the corset as an indispensable garment.
