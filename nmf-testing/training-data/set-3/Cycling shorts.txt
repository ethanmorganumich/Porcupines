Cycling shorts (also known as bike shorts, bicycling shorts, chamois, knicks, or spats or thigh cling shorts) are short, skin-tight garments designed to improve comfort and efficiency while cycling.Their useful properties are:

reduce wind resistance, increasing aerodynamic efficiency;
protect the skin against the repetitive friction of the legs against the bicycle seat or frame;
provide support to the genitals, analogously to a jock strap;
draw sweat away from the skin to prevent chafing and rashes, and to cool the rider down through the process of evaporation;
compress the legs, which can help combat muscular fatigue;
do not get caught up in the bike chain or other parts of the bike;
reduce the weight of a rider's clothing (compared to wearing denim, gym shorts or baggy shorts); and
improve comfort during long rides with extra padding in the seat area (called the cycling pad).Historically, cycling shorts were made of knit black wool, which hides wear marks caused by sitting on an oiled leather saddle for extended periods of time, with a chamois leather padding inside the shorts in the crotch area, which reduces chafing from the bicycle saddle.  Modern cycling shorts are often made of spandex (Lycra) with a synthetic chamois which acts as an elastic interface between the cyclist's body and the saddle, and are produced in a variety of shapes and styles to suit the needs of different riders. On some cycling shorts different materials are often placed on different parts of the shorts to take advantage of each material's benefit, providing a very efficient cycling short. For example, the patterns used for the chamois on women's cycling shorts tend to be quite different from those used for men's. The hem of each leg is usually lined with elastic and/or silicone that clings to the skin, keeping it in a fixed position. These shorts made from several panels (or cuts of fabric) fit better and are more beneficial, especially for racers, but cost more.
Short-legged elastic tights commonly worn as street wear, under girls' skirts and dresses, with longer oversized t-shirts, sweat shirts and sweaters, for gymnastics and ballet practice, or under athletic and running shorts, are sometimes also referred to as "bike shorts", but they are typically simpler and lighter garments than those worn by cyclists and generally lack the chamois or faux-chamois lining and may have plain or lace trimmed hems.
