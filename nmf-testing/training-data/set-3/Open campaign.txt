Open campaign

An open campaign can encompass several definitions.
An open campaign may be a set of public protest actions against a person (e.g. a politician), an organization (e.g. a private education association), or a corporation with a clear goal and transparent methods.
In most cases, people who organise an open campaign are people willing to act by themselves, rather than strictly relying on politicians or other leaders. They often are willing to take control of their struggle and define their priorities, and work as a team, with little or no hierarchy, but rather favor people to participate with their own skills.
Typical open campaigns rely on organizing talks, video displays, mailings, protest letters, leaflets distributions, articles in newspapers, petitions. The location and time of a campaign is usually heavily dependent upon the focus chosen.The signs of an open campaign are ones associated with mystery, uncertainty, consensus and discussion. Open campaign is mysterious in that it is often difficult to pinpoint a head or a leader. There is fair levels of uncertainty when it comes to the next steps within the campaign journey. Decisions are usually passed through discussions and consensus.
