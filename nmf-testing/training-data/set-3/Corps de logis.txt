Corps de logis
||||||
In architecture, a corps de logis (French pronunciation: ​[kɔʁ də lɔʒi]) is the principal block of a large, (usually classical), mansion or palace.  It contains the principal rooms, state apartments and an entry.  The grandest and finest rooms are often on the first floor above the ground level: this floor is the piano nobile.
The corps de logis is usually flanked by lower secondary wings, such as the barchesse of Venetian villas.  When the secondary wings form a three sided courtyard, the courtyard is known as the cour d'honneur.
Examples of a corps de logis can be found in many of the most notable Classical Era buildings of Europe including the Palace of Versailles, Blenheim Palace, and the Palazzo Pitti.
In France, the principal block of medieval castles and manor houses is often referred to as the corps de logis.
