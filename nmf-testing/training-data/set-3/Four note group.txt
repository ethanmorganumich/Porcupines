Four note group
||||||
In music, four note group patterns, alternately called "four-note digital patterns" or simply "four note patterns", are one of many ways to formulate improvised solos in jazz. "Four-Note Grouping is an improvisation technique that uses major and minor triads along with specific passing notes as a means of generating lines. The concept of Four-Note Groupings lets the lines be more 'out' and stretch the possibility of available notes over a chord due to the structural integrity of the triad-based line."
