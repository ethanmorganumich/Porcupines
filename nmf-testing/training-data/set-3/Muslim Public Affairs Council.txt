Muslim Public Affairs Council
||||||
The Muslim Public Affairs Council (MPAC) is a national American Muslim advocacy and public policy organization headquartered in Los Angeles and with offices in Washington, D.C. MPAC was founded in 1988.
According to the organizationâ€™s website, MPAC seeks to correct misperceptions and improve public understanding and policies that affect American Muslims by engaging directly with key members of the government, media and local communities. The group has been criticized within mainstream American Islam for taking charity in violation of the Quran and for joining an Amicus Brief in the Gerald Lynn Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia case.
