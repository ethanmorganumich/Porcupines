Alice from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland is one of the most iconic figures to emerge from 19th century children's literature, and one who is instantly recognized by her attire. Although many artists have depicted Alice in many different ways, the original illustrations by John Tenniel have become iconic through their subsequent repetition (with generally minimal alterations) in most published editions and film adaptations.The headband depicted by Tenniel became so linked to Alice that it gave rise to the term "Alice band".
