Jack and Jill (dance)
||||||
Jack and Jill is a format of competition in partner dancing, where the competing couples are the result of random matching of leaders and followers. Rules of matching vary. 
The name and format were created by Jack Carey at Hank & Stans in Norwalk, California in the early 1950s to encourage a variety of dancers to enter competitions.The gender-ambiguous term Pat and Chris has been used, particularly in LGBT dance venues, to refer to events where the gender of lead and follow isn't specified. In the swing dance community, the name Mix & Match (M&M) is now used as a gender-neutral, more inclusive name.In dance competitions J&J is included as a separate division (or divisions, with additional gradations).
J&J is popular at Swing conventions, as well as at ballroom dance competitions in the US.
J&J competitions are intended to test social dance skills, whereas fixed partner competitions test performance dance skills.
