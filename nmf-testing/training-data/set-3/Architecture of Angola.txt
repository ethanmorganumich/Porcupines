Architecture of Angola
||||||
The architecture of Angola spans three distinct historical periods: precolonial, colonial and independent.   The impact of Portuguese colonial control over Angola has left a large architectural legacy in the country.  However, present-day Angola is increasingly influenced by broader global trends in architecture, especially as a result of the country's oil-boom in the early 21st Century.
