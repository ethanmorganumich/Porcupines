Teaching philosophy
||||||
The teaching philosophy of a candidate for an academic position, sometimes referred to as a teaching philosophy statement, is a written statement of the candidate's general personal views on teaching.  Colleges and universities that advertise a position whose duties require teaching often require the applicant to submit a teaching philosophy with the application. Teaching philosophy statements are becoming increasingly required in the attainment of teaching positions. Teaching philosophy statement often attempts to express what methods of teaching the candidate practices and what educational styles they intend to make use of. Teaching philosophy statements are generally reviewed and updated as educators gain more experience to reflect their current views and beliefs.
