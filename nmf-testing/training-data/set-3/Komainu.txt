Komainu
||||||
Komainu (狛犬), often called lion-dogs in English, are statue pairs of lion-like creatures either guarding the entrance or the honden, or inner shrine of many Japanese Shinto shrines or kept inside the inner shrine itself, where they are not visible to the public. The first type, born during the Edo period, is called sandō komainu (参道狛犬, lit. 'entrance-road Komainu'), the second and much older type jinnai komainu (陣内狛犬, lit. 'komainu inside the shrine'). They can sometimes be found also at Buddhist temples, nobility residences or even private homes.
