Plague doctor costume
||||||
The clothing worn by plague doctors was intended to protect them from airborne diseases during outbreaks of bubonic plague in Europe. It is often seen as a symbol of death and disease. However, the costume was worn by a comparatively small number of late Renaissance and early modern physicians studying and treating plague patients.
