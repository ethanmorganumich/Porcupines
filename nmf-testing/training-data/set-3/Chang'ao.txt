Chang-ao (simplified Chinese: 长袄; traditional Chinese: 長襖), lit. translated as "long jacket" or "long ao", is a historical long-length, Chinese upper garment called ao (袄), which was worn by women. It is also known as da ao (大袄) and chang ru (长襦; long ru jacket) which appears to be the precursor of the ao.When paired with a skirt, the chang-ao forms a style of aoqun (i.e. jacket worn over a skirt). This set of attire is worn as a formal attire.
