Foundation garment
||||||
A foundation garment (also known as shapewear or shaping underwear) is an undergarment designed to impermanently alter the wearer's body shape, to achieve what some view as a more fashionable figure. The function of a foundation garment is not to enhance a bodily feature (as would, for example, a padded bra) but to make it look more presentable. 
Specific styles of foundation garments have been essential to some fashion movements, and were required in some social situations during various fashion periods.
