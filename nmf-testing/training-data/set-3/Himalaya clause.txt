Himalaya clause
||||||
A Himalaya clause is a contractual provision expressed to be for the benefit of a third party who is not a party to the contract.  Although theoretically applicable to any form of contract, most of the jurisprudence relating to Himalaya clauses relate to maritime matters, and exclusion clauses in bills of lading for the benefit of employees, crew, and  agents, stevedores in particular.
