A Man's A Man for A' That
||||||
"A Man's a Man for A' That", also known as "Is There for Honest Poverty" (Scottish Gaelic: A bheil Bochdainn Onarach Ann) or "For a' That and a' That", is a 1795 song by Robert Burns, written in Scots and English, famous for its expression of egalitarian ideas of society, which may be seen as expressing the ideas of republicanism that arose in the 18th century.
Scottish folksinger Sheena Wellington sang the song at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in May, 1999. Midge Ure did the same in July 2016. The song was also sung at the funeral of Donald Dewar, the inaugural First Minister of Scotland. It is also known in translations into other European languages, for example the German "Trotz alledem und alledem" by Ferdinand Freiligrath right after the Revolution of 1848 (sung by Hannes Wader as "Trotz alledem").
The words "pride o' worth" appear on the crest of the Scottish Qualifications Authority.
