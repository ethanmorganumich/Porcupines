National Bolshevism (Russian: национал-большевизм, romanized: natsional-bol'shevizm, German: Nationalbolschewismus), whose supporters are known as National Bolsheviks (Russian: национал-большевики, romanized: natsional-bol'sheviki) or Nazbols (Russian: нацболы, romanized: natsboly), is a syncretic neo-fascist political movement that combines ultranationalism and Bolshevism.Notable historical proponents of National Bolshevism in Germany included Ernst Niekisch (1889–1967), Heinrich Laufenberg (1872–1932), and Karl Otto Paetel (1906–1975). In Russia, Nikolay Ustryalov (1890–1937) and his followers, the Smenovekhovtsy, used the term. Notable modern advocates of the movement include Aleksandr Dugin and Eduard Limonov, the leader of the unregistered and banned National Bolshevik Party (NBP) in the Russian Federation.
