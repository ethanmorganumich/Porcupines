Aeolian dominant scale
||||||
The Hindu scale (also known as the Aeolian dominant scale, Olympian Scale, Mixolydian ♭6 [or ♭13], Aeolian major, and melodic major) is the fifth mode of the melodic minor scale. It is named such because its sound derives from having a dominant seventh chord on the tonic in the context of what is otherwise the Aeolian mode.
It corresponds to Raga Charukeshi in Indian Classical music.
This scale can also be obtained by raising the third degree of the natural minor scale or lowering the sixth degree of the mixolydian scale.

The name melodic major also refers to the combined scale that proceeds as natural major ascending and as Aeolian dominant descending.
The Mask of Zorro song "I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You", was composed in the Aeolian dominant scale mode. It was written by film composer James Horner.The Aeolian dominant scale mode can also be heard in the song Valar Morghulis of the Game of Thrones: Season 2 soundtrack, composed by Ramin Djawadi.
