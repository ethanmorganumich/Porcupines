Lamé (fabric)
||||||
Lamé ( lah-MAY) is a type of fabric woven or knit with thin ribbons of metallic fiber, as opposed to guipé, where the ribbons are wrapped around a fibre yarn. It is usually gold or silver in color; sometimes copper lamé is seen. Lamé comes in different varieties, depending on the composition of the other threads in the fabric. Common examples are tissue lamé, hologram lamé and pearl lamé.An issue with lamé is that it is subject to seam or yarn slippage, making it less than ideal for garments with frequent usage. Lamé is often used in evening and dress wear and in theatrical and dance costumes. It is   a favourite material in futuristic costumes and spacesuits for science fiction television and films.
Lamé is also used for its conductive properties in the sport of fencing to make the overjackets (called lamés) that allow touches to be scored.
