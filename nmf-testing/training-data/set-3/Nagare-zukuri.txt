Nagare-zukuri

The nagare-zukuri (流造, streamlined roof style) or nagare hafu-zukuri (流破風造, streamlined gabled style) is a traditional Shinto shrine architectural style characterized by a very asymmetrical gabled roof (kirizuma-yane (切妻屋根)) projecting outwards on one of the non-gabled sides, above the main entrance, to form a portico (see photo).  This is the feature which gives it its name. It is the most common style among shrines all over the country. That the building has its main entrance on the side which runs parallel to the roof's ridge (non gabled-side) makes it belong to the hirairi or hirairi-zukuri (平入・平入造) style.
