A bench table (French: banc; Italian: sedile; German: Bank) is a low stone seat which runs round the interior of the walls of many large churches. Bench tables are also found around the bases of pillars, and in porches and cloisters.A bench table is also known as a table with a bench seat, which is a type of long seat that has the purpose of holding more than 1 person at one time. Commonly, a Bench table is placed in outdoor locations such as the garden, park, and side of the pedestrian passage. But also indoor spaces, especially public venues like airports, government offices and churches, often place bench tables.
Bench table has various types of geometric forms. The most familiar one is the rectangular-shaped bench table and the circular-shaped bench table. Moreover, it has discrete size of widths and lengths depending on the location. Generally, churches have bench tables with narrow width and long length in terms of accepting many people in the limited size of the place. On the other hand, bench tables which are located at outdoor locations such as parks have a large surface so that people can put things for dining, studying and working on the table.
Also, Bench tables are manufactured in diverse types of materials. The most original material of the bench table is wooden board. In the middle age of Europe, English oak was the leading material of medieval times, but also softened woods are used in manufacturing bench tables.
