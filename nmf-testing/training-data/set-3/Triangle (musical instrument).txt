Triangle (musical instrument)
||||||
The triangle is a musical instrument in the percussion family, and is classified as an idiophone in the Hornbostel-Sachs classification system.  Triangles are made from a variety of metals including aluminum, beryllium copper, brass, bronze, iron, and steel.  The metal is formed into a triangle shape by bending or casting methods.  The instrument is usually held by a loop of some form of thread or wire at the top curve. The triangle theoretically has indefinite pitch, and produces a plurality of overtones when struck with an appropriate beater.
