Vibrato
||||||
Vibrato (Italian, from past participle of "vibrare", to vibrate) is a musical effect consisting of a regular, pulsating change of pitch. It is used to add expression to vocal and instrumental music. Vibrato is typically characterised in terms of two factors: the amount of pitch variation ("extent of vibrato") and the speed with which the pitch is varied ("rate of vibrato").In singing it can occur spontaneously through variations in the larynx.  The vibrato of a string instrument and wind instrument is an imitation of that vocal function.
