Andean music

Andean music is a group of styles of music from the Andes region in South America.
Original chants and melodies come from the general area inhabited by Quechuas (originally from Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Chile), Aymaras (originally from Bolivia), and other peoples who lived roughly in the area of the  Inca Empire prior to European contact. This early music then was fused with Spanish music elements. It includes folklore music of parts of Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Andean music is popular to different degrees across Latin America, having its core public in rural areas and among indigenous populations. The Nueva Canci√≥n movement of the 1970s revived the genre across Latin America and brought it to places where it was unknown or forgotten.
