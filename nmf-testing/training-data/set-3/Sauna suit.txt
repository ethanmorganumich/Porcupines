Sauna suit
||||||
A sauna suit is a garment made from waterproof fabric designed to make the wearer sweat profusely. A sauna suit is sometimes called a "rubber suit" because the early types were made of rubber or rubberized cloth.  Now, sauna suits are typically made of PVC or coated nylon cloth.  The construction is typically in the style of a waterproof sweat suit, consisting of a pullover jacket and drawstring pants.  The closures at waist, neck, wrists and ankles are all elasticated to help retain body heat and moisture within the garment.  In some sauna suits, the jacket also includes a hood to provide additional retention of body heat.
