Architecture of Aylesbury
||||||
The architecture of Aylesbury, the county town of Buckinghamshire, reflects that which can be found in many small towns the length and breadth of England.  The architecture contained in many of the country's great cities is well recorded and documented, as is that of the  numerous great country houses. Frequently the work is by one of England's more notable architects â€“ Christopher Wren, John Vanbrugh, Robert Adam, William Kent or even Quinlan Terry.  What is less well known is the local almost vernacular architecture in the market towns, often inspired by the work of the great master architects or the general architectural style popular at the time. England had a middle class long before many other European countries, these bourgeois merchants would often return from a visit to one of the cities, or having seen a glimpse of one of the great country houses then require a replica of what they had seen. A local architect would then be employed to recreate it, within limited financial restraints.  Sometimes the patron would merely draw an image of what he required and a builder would then interpret the requirements to the best of his often limited ability.
This recreation and interpretation of a certain style was not confined to private houses, but to civic architecture too: an illustrious architect added to civic pride; and when an architect was too expensive for the civic coffers, for a fraction of the price he would judge a competition between local architects, for the privilege of designing a town hall or church.  This is exactly what happened in Aylesbury. John Vanbrugh judged two sets of plans for the County Hall (now Aylesbury Crown Court).  Thus for ever Vanbrugh's name was remembered in association with the building, the local architect almost forgotten, and civic pride maintained.
It is this provincial, often unappreciated and unnoticed architecture, by nationally unknown architects still being produced today which continues to give many English market towns their unique atmosphere and character, the architecture of Aylesbury demonstrates this admirably from the 11th century to the 21st century. 1000 years of provincial architecture in one town little known outside of Britain.
