Pointe technique
||||||
Pointe technique ( pwant) is the part of classical ballet technique that concerns pointe work, in which a ballet dancer supports all body weight on the tips of fully extended feet within pointe shoes. A dancer is said to be en pointe () when the dancer's body is supported in this manner, and a fully extended vertical foot is said to be en pointe when touching the floor, even when not bearing weight. Pointe work is performed while wearing pointe shoes, which employ structural reinforcing to distribute the dancer's weight load throughout the foot, thus reducing the load on the toes enough to enable the dancer to support all body weight on fully vertical feet. But this assertion is disputed. Nothing in pointe shoe design prevents ‘slippage’ where, when en pointe, the dancer’s weight forces their foot down into the shoe until their big toe impacts the end of the toe box. Measurements have shown that the majority of the dancer's weight is then born by the big toe(s) regardless of the length of the second toe. Therefore, the ‘structural reinforcements’ (shank and toe box) do not and cannot distribute the weight load throughout the foot as claimed. Pointe technique resulted from a desire for female dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like. Although both men and women are capable of pointe work, it is most often performed by women. Extensive training and practice are required to develop the strength and technique needed for pointe work. Typically, dance teachers consider factors such as age, experience, strength and alignment when deciding whether to allow a dancer to begin pointe work.
