1880s fashion in the in Western and Western-influenced countries is characterized by the return of the bustle.  The long, lean line of the late 1870s was replaced by a full, curvy silhouette with gradually widening shoulders.  Fashionable waists were low and tiny below a full, low bust supported by a corset.  The Rational Dress Society was founded in 1881 in reaction to the extremes of fashionable corsetry.
