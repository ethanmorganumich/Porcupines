Usucaption
||||||
Usucaption (Latin: usucapio), also known as acquisitive prescription, is a concept found in civil law systems and has its origin in the Roman law of property.
Usucaption is a method by which ownership of property (i.e. title to the property) can be gained by possession of it beyond the lapse of a certain period of time (acquiescence). While usucaption has been compared with adverse possession (that is, squatting), the true effect of usucaption is to remedy defects in title of lands that are without encumbrance on them.
