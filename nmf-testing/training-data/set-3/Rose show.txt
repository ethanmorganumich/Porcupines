Charlie Rose (talk show)
||||||
Charlie Rose (also known as The Charlie Rose Show) is an American television interview and talk show, with Charlie Rose as executive producer, executive editor, and host. The show was syndicated on PBS from 1991 until 2017 and is owned by Charlie Rose, Inc. Rose interviewed thinkers, writers, politicians, athletes, entertainers, businesspersons, leaders, scientists, and fellow newsmakers.
On November 20, 2017, WNET, Bloomberg Television and PBS announced the suspension of distribution of the show after former employees of Charlie Rose, Inc. alleged Rose sexually harassed them. Bloomberg Television also pulled reruns of the series within only an hour's notice. The next day, both PBS and Bloomberg cancelled distribution of the program and terminated their relationship with Rose; this de facto cancelled the show. CNNMoney reported on November 29 that Rose called the show's staffers and let them know they would be paid until the end of the year and released from their contracts at the start of 2018; their access to the Bloomberg headquarters where the show recorded to remove personal effects would be terminated on December 8.On December 4, it was announced that Amanpour, a CNN International interview program hosted by Christiane Amanpour, would re-air on PBS as an interim replacement for Charlie Rose. The show was ultimately replaced by Amanpour as Amanpour & Company.
