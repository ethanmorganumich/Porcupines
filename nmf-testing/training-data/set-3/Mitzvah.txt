Bar and bat mitzvah
||||||
Bar mitzvah (Hebrew: בַּר מִצְוָה) and bat mitzvah (Hebrew: בַּת מִצְוָה; Ashkenazi pronunciation: bas mitzveh) refer to the Jewish coming of age ritual (the word bar is used for a boy, and bat/bas  for a girl). The plural is b'nei mitzvah for both boys and mixed gender groups, or b'not mitzvah (Ashkenazi pronunciation: b'nos mitzvah) for girls. B'mitzvah is increasingly used in many communities to include youth of all genders.According to Jewish law, before children reach a certain age, the parents are responsible for their child's actions. Once Jewish children reach that age, they are said to "become" a b'mitzvah, at which point they begin to be held accountable for their own actions. (Traditionally, the father of a bar or bat mitzvah offers thanks to God that he is no longer punished for his child's sins.) 
In Orthodox communities, boys become bar mitzvah at 13 and girls become bat mitzvah at 12. In most Reform, Reconstructionist, and Conservative communities, children of all genders reach the milestone at 13. After this point, children are also held responsible for knowing Jewish ritual law, tradition, and ethics, and are able to participate in all areas of Jewish community life to the same extent as adults. In some Jewish communities, men's and women's roles differ in certain respects. For example, in Orthodox Judaism, once a boy turns 13, it is permitted to count him for the purpose of determining whether there is a prayer quorum, and he may lead prayer and other religious services in the family and the community.Bar mitzvah is mentioned in the Mishnah and the Talmud. Some classic sources identify the age at which children  must begin to participate in the ritual of fasting on Yom Kippur as 13 for boys and 12 for girls.   The age of b'nai mitzvah roughly coincides with the onset of puberty. The bar or bat mitzvah ceremony is usually held on the first Shabbat after the birthday on which the child reaches the eligible age.
