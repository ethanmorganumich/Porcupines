Slouch socks
||||||
Slouch socks (slouchy socks) are a type of sock featuring a heavy non-elastic upper that may be pushed down into heavy folds around the ankles or pulled up to the knee. Slouch socks tend to have a foot that is made of very thin fabric to encourage the layering of the socks.  Slouch socks have trended in and out of fashion since the 1980's and now may be considered by some to be nostalgic fashion accessories.
