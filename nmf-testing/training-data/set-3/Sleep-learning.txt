Sleep-learning
||||||
Sleep-learning (also known as hypnop√¶dia, or hypnopedia) is an attempt to convey information to a sleeping person, typically by playing a sound recording to them while they sleep. Although sleep is considered an important period for memory consolidation, scientific research has concluded that sleep-learning is not possible. However, it appears frequently in fiction.
