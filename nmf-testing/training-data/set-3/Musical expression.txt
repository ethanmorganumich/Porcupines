Musical expression
||||||
Musical expression is the art of playing or singing with a personal response to the music.At a practical level, this means making appropriate use of dynamics, phrasing, timbre and articulation to bring the music to life.  Composers may specify these aspects of expression to a greater or lesser extent in the notation of their musical score.
The nature of musical expression has also been discussed at a theoretical level throughout of the history of classical music. One common view is that music both expresses and evokes emotion, forming a conduit for emotional communication between the musician and the audience. This view has been present through most of musical history, though it was most clearly expressed in musical romanticism.  However, emotion's role in music has been challenged on occasion by those like Igor Stravinsky who see music as a pure art form and expression as an irrelevant distraction.
