Filet lace is the general word used for all the different techniques of embroidery on knotted net (or in French broderie sur filet nou√©). It is a hand made needlework created by weaving or embroidery using a long blunt needle and a thread on a ground of knotted net lace or filet work made of square or diagonal meshes of the same sizes or of different sizes. Lacis uses the same technique but is made on a ground of leno (a woven fabric) or small canvas (not a knotted lace).
