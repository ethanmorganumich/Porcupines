Seguidilla

The seguidilla (; Spanish: [seɣiˈðiʎa]; plural in both English and Spanish seguidillas; diminutive of seguida, which means "sequence" and is the name of a dance) is an old Castilian folksong and dance form in quick triple time for two people with many regional variations. The music is generally in a major key and often begins on an offbeat. 
The term is also used for a Spanish stanza form with four to seven short, partly assonant lines in a characteristic rhythm.
