A yashmak, yashmac or yasmak (from Turkish yaşmak, "a veil") is a Turkish and Turkmen type of veil or niqāb worn by women to cover their faces in public. Today there is almost no usage of this garment in Turkey. In Turkmenistan, however, it is still consciously used by some married women in the presence of elder relatives of a husband.
