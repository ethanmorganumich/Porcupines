Brâncovenesc art or Brâncovenesc style (Romanian pronunciation: [/brɨŋkovenesk/]; Romanian: artă brâncovenească or stil brâncovenesc), also known as the Wallachian Renaissance or the Romanian Renaissance, is an artistic style that evolved during the administration of Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu in the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Brâncoveanu was an administrator of the Principality of Wallachia (between 1688 and 1714) under Ottoman Empire overlords, an extremely wealthy aristocrat, and a builder of fine palaces and churches. Brâncovenesc art was mostly focused on architecture, but also manifested through painting and sculpture.
