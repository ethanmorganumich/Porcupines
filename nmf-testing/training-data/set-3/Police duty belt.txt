Police duty belt
||||||
A police duty belt (sometimes referred to as a gun belt, "duty rig" and/or kit belt) is a belt, typically constructed of nylon or leather used by police,  prison and security officers to carry equipment easily in a series of pouches attached to the belt, in a readily-accessible manner, while leaving the hands free to interact. This belt can carry any number of useful items, ranging from handcuffs to guns.
The duty belt came into use in the early 1900s, in lieu of carrying the required equipment in greatcoat pockets or additional bags. These early types were almost exclusively made of dark colored leather with simple pockets or clip systems attached, such as the Sam Browne belt. However, there are some issues with the use of a duty belt, with the large amount of equipment carried on modern duty belts often carrying more than 20 lbs (9 kg) of equipment.
