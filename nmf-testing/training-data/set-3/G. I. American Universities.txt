G.I. American universities
||||||
In May 1945, the U.S. Army's Information and Educational Branch was ordered to establish an overseas university campus for demobilized American service men and women in Florence, Italy. Two further campuses were later established, in August 1945: the first in the French resort town of Biarritz and the second in the English town of Shrivenham, Berkshire. These three campuses were set up to provide a transition between army life and subsequent attendance at a university in the US, and therefore students attended for just one term.
Students removed their caps, and therefore the distinction between officers and enlisted personnel was eliminated.A detailed discussion of these G. I. American Universities can be found at The G.I. University Project.
