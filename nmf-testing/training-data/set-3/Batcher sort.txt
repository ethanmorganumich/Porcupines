Bitonic sorter
||||||
Bitonic mergesort is a parallel algorithm for sorting. It is also used as a construction method for building a sorting network. The algorithm was devised by Ken Batcher. The resulting sorting networks consist of 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        n
        
          log
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        n
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n\log ^{2}(n))}
   comparators and have a delay of 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          log
          
            2
          
        
        ⁡
        (
        n
        )
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(\log ^{2}(n))}
  , where 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the number of items to be sorted.A sorted sequence is a monotonically non-decreasing (or non-increasing) sequence. A bitonic sequence is a sequence with 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            0

    {\displaystyle x_{0}\leq \cdots \leq x_{k}\geq \cdots \geq x_{n-1}}
   for some 
  
    
      
        k
        ,
        0
        ≤
        k
        <
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle k,0\leq k<n}
  , or a circular shift of such a sequence.
