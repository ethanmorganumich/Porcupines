Pas kontuszowy
||||||
Kontush belt ("kontusz sash" or the Slutsk sash; Lithuanian: kontušo juosta, Belarusian: слуцкi пояс) was a cloth sash used for girding a kontusz (a robe-like garment). It was one of the most distinctive items of male dress of Polish and Lithuanian nobility (szlachta) from about 17th through the 19th centuries. In an earlier period, sometimes narrower sashes of fine cloth or silk net were worn, but the wide kontusz sash is specific to the later period.
