Ponytail
||||||
A ponytail is a hairstyle in which some, most or all of the hair on the head is pulled away from the face, gathered and secured at the back of the head with a hair tie, clip, or other similar accessory and allowed to hang freely from that point. It gets its name from its resemblance to the tail of a pony.
Ponytails are most commonly gathered at the middle of the back of the head or the base of the neck but may also be worn at the side of the head  (sometimes considered formal), or on the very top of the head. If the hair is divided so that it hangs in two sections, they are called ponytails, twintails, pigtails, or bunches if left loose and pigtails, plaits or braids if plaited.
