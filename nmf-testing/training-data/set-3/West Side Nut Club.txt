West Side Nut Club Fall Festival
||||||
The West Side Nut Club Fall Festival is an annual event held the first full week of every October on Franklin Street in Evansville, Indiana, and is organized by the West Side Nut Club. The festival features over 136 food booths run and operated by not-for-profit groups in the region. It features an eclectic variety of food, particularly both traditional and unique fried food. The festival also includes numerous forms of entertainment, carnival attractions, amateur talent competitions, and a parade. 
Event organizers estimate that each night of the week-long festival draws between 100,000 and 150,000 people, making it one of the largest street festivals in the United States. Although he lacked statistics to support his claim, radio host Paul Harvey once called it the second-largest street festival in the U.S., in terms of attendees, behind only the New Orleans Mardi Gras.
