Axiomatic semantics
||||||
Axiomatic semantics is an approach based on mathematical logic for proving the correctness of computer programs. It is closely related to Hoare logic.
Axiomatic semantics define the meaning of a command in a program by describing its effect on assertions about the program state. The assertions are logical statementsâ€”predicates with variables, where the variables define the state of the program.
