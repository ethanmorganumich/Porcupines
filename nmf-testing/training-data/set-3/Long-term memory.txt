Long-term memory

Long-term memory (LTM) is the stage of the Atkinsonâ€“Shiffrin memory model in which  informative knowledge is held indefinitely. It is defined in contrast to short-term and working memory, which persist for only about 18 to 30 seconds. Long-term memory is commonly labelled as explicit memory (declarative), as well as episodic memory, semantic memory, autobiographical memory, and implicit memory (procedural memory).
