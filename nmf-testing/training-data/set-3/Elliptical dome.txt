Elliptical dome
||||||
An elliptical dome, or an oval dome, is a dome whose bottom cross-section takes the form of an ellipse. Technically, an ellipsoidal dome has a circular cross-section, so is not quite the same.
While the cupola can take different geometries, when the ceiling's cross-section takes the form of an ellipse, and due to the reflecting properties of an ellipse, any two persons standing at a focus of the floor's ellipse can have one whisper, and the other hears; this is a whispering gallery.
The largest elliptical dome in the world is at the Sanctuary of Vicoforte in Vicoforte, Italy.
