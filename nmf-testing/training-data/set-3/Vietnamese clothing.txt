Trang phục Việt (Chữ Hán: 裝服越), Việt phục (Chữ Hán: 越服) or Quần áo Việt (Chữ Hán: 裙襖越) all literally meaning Vietnamese clothing, is the traditional style of clothing worn in Vietnam by the Vietnamese people, including the unofficial national dress of Vietnam, the áo dài. The clothing in Vietnam has both indigenous and foreign elements due to the diverse cultural exchanges during the history of Vietnam; this all eventually led to the birth of a distinctive Vietnamese style of clothing.

In daily wear, Vietnamese people just wear Western clothing called Âu phục, but now its common name is quần áo thường ngày (literally "everyday clothing").
