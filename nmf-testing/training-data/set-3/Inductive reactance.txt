Electrical reactance
||||||
In electrical circuits, reactance is the opposition presented to alternating current by inductance or capacitance. Greater reactance gives smaller current for the same applied voltage. Reactance is similar to resistance in this respect, but does not lead to dissipation of electrical energy as heat; instead, energy is momentarily stored in the reactance, and a quarter-cycle later returned to the circuit.
Reactance is used to compute amplitude and phase changes of sinusoidal alternating current going through a circuit element.  Like resistance, reactance is measured in ohms, with positive values indicating inductive reactance and negative indicating capacitive reactance.  It is denoted by the symbol 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  . An ideal resistor has zero reactance, whereas ideal inductors and capacitors have zero resistance. As frequency increases, inductive reactance increases and capacitive reactance decreases.
