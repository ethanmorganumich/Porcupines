Inform
||||||
Inform is a programming language and design system for interactive fiction originally created in 1993 by Graham Nelson.  Inform can generate programs designed for the Z-code or Glulx virtual machines.   Versions 1 through 5 were released between 1993 and 1996.  Around 1996, Nelson rewrote Inform from first principles to create version 6 (or Inform 6).
Over the following decade, version 6 became reasonably stable and a popular language for writing interactive fiction.  In 2006, Nelson released Inform 7 (briefly known as Natural Inform), a completely new language based on principles of natural language and a new set of tools based around a book-publishing metaphor.
