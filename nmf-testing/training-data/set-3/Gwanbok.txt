Gwanbok (Korean pronunciation: [goanbok]) is a Korean term which was borrowed from the Chinese terms guanfu (Chinese: 冠服; lit. 'crown [ guan ] and clothing'  or 'hats and clothing' and Korean: 관복; Hanja: 冠服; RR: gwanbok; lit. hat  [ guan ] and clothing) and/or the Chinese term guanfu (Chinese: guānfú; Chinese: 官服; lit. 'court clothing'; Korean: 관복; Hanja: 官服; RR: gwanbok). The term gwanbok (관복; 冠服) is a collective term which refers to historical official attire, which was bestowed by the government court, including Chinese courts of various dynasties. The Guanfu (冠服) system was a court attire system in China which also formed part of the Hanfu (simplified Chinese: 汉服; traditional Chinese: 漢服; pinyin: Hànfú; lit. 'Han Chinese clothing') system. This system was them spread to neighbouring countries and was adopted in Korea since the ancient times in different periods through the ritual practice of bestowal of clothing. Acknowledgement through bestowed robes and crowns (冠服) from the Emperor of China, who held hegemony over East Asia, would give support to Korean Kings and successors, as being the authentic rulers of their country as well as confirmed the political status of the Korean kingdom in the rest of the Sinosphere. The Gwanbok (관복; 冠服) system in Korea was different for each kingdom and changed throughout different periods. For example, initially given by the Chinese court in ritual practice, successive gwanbok were more often than not locally manufactured in Korea with different colours and adopted into Hanbok. The gwanbok (관복; 官服), which was used as the uniform of the court officials (including the civil court officials), formed part of the Gwanbok (관복; 冠服) system and was used like how the suit is used in nowadays.
