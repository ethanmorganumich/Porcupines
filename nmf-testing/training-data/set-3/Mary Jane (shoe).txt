Mary Jane (shoe)
||||||
Mary Jane (also known as bar shoes or doll shoes) is an American term (formerly a registered trademark) for a closed, low-cut shoe with one or more straps across the instep.
Classic Mary Janes for children are typically made of black leather or patent leather, have one thin strap fastened with a buckle or button, a broad and rounded toe box, low heels, and thin outsoles. Among girls, Mary Janes are traditionally worn with tights, pantyhose, socks, or completely without them (on bare feet), and a dress or a skirt and blouse. Among boys (less common), Mary Janes are traditionally worn with socks (or without them as well), short trousers and a shirt.
