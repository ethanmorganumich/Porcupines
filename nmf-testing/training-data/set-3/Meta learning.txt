Meta-learning
||||||
Meta-learning is a branch of metacognition concerned with learning about one's own learning and learning processes. 
The term comes from the meta prefix's modern meaning of an abstract recursion, or "X about X", similar to its use in metaknowledge, metamemory, and meta-emotion.
