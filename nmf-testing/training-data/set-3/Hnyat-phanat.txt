Hnyat-phanat
||||||
Hnyat-phanat (Burmese: ညှပ်ဖိနပ်; MLCTS: hnyap hpi. nap, IPA: [ɲ̥appʰənaʔ]) is a Burmese traditional sandal, similar to flip-flops. Although it refers to almost any sandal worn by the people of Myanmar, it is mostly used to refer to the traditional Mandalay velvet slippers that originate in Upper Burma (Myanmar).
Hnyat-phanat literally means 'clip footwear', since the slipper is held in place by the clipping of the big and second toe.
