In the Middle Ages, Thomas Aquinas argued that it was a moral obligation of businesses to sell goods at a just price.In the Western world, economics was not a separate discipline, but part of philosophy until the 18thâ€“19th century Industrial Revolution and the 19th century Great Divergence, which accelerated economic growth in The World.
