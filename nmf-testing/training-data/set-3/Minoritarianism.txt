Minoritarianism
||||||
In political science, minoritarianism (or minorityism) is a neologism for a political structure or process in which a minority segment of a population has a certain degree of primacy in that entity's decision making. Minoritarianism may be contrasted with majoritarianism, with legislative power being held or controlled by a minority group rather than the majority.
