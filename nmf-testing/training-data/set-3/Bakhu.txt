Sikkim Costumes and Traditional Dress
||||||
The Kho or Bakhu is a traditional dress worn by Bhutia, ethnic Sikkimese people of Sikkim and Nepal. It is a loose, cloak-style garment that is fastened at the neck on one side and near the waist with a silk or cotton belt similar to the Tibetan chuba and to the Ngalop gho of Bhutan, but sleeveless.
Women wear a silken, full-sleeve blouse called a honju inside the kho; a loose gown type garment fastened near the waist, tightened with a belt. Married women tie a multi-coloured striped apron of woolen cloth called pangden around their waist.
