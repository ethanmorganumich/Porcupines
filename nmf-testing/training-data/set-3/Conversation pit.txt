Conversation pit
||||||
A conversation pit is an architectural feature that incorporates built-in seating into a depressed section of flooring within a larger room.  This area often has a table in the center as well.  The seats typically face each other in a centrally focused fashion, bringing the occupants  closer together than free-standing tables and chairs normally would.  In residential design this proximity facilitates comfortable human conversation, dinner parties, and table top games. Their disadvantages include accidental falls and uncomfortable interactions with those standing above in the main room.
