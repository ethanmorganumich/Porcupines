Gaiters
||||||
Gaiters are garments worn over the shoe and bottom of the pant or trouser leg, and used primarily as personal protective equipment;  similar garments used primarily for display are spats.
Originally, gaiters were made of leather or canvas. Today, gaiters for walking are commonly made of plasticized synthetic cloth such as polyester.  Gaiters for use on horseback continue to be made of leather. They are able to cover the gap between the pants and boots and the top is just below the knee. There are usually drawcords to help adjust the tightness. Wearing gaiters, while largely preventing most snake bites, does not provide 100% protection. 
Common materials for leg gaiters on the market are canvas, nylon, Cordura, Kevlar and leather. Nylon is better at preventing snake bites than polyester, canvas and Cordura. The best material is Kevlar, a bulletproof material commonly used to make bulletproof vests, protective gear, and protective clothing. But the downside of Kevlar is that it is expensive.
