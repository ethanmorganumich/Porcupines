Universal key
||||||
The universal key or universal scale is a concept employed in music theory in which specific notes or chord symbols in a key signature are replaced with numbers or Roman numerals, allowing for a discussion describing relationships between notes or chords that can be universally applied to all key signatures.
For example, in the key of E-flat major, the notes of the scale would be replaced like so:

E♭ becomes scale degree 1
F becomes scale degree 2
G becomes scale degree 3
A♭ becomes scale degree 4
B♭ becomes scale degree 5
C becomes scale degree 6
D becomes scale degree 7
