A chhajja is an overhanging eave or roof covering found in Indian architecture. It is characterised with large support brackets with different artistic designs. Variation is also seen in its size depending on the importance of the building on which it features or the choice of the designer.Its function is similar to that of other overhangs or eaves in that it protects and adorns entrances, arches and windows from the outside elements. Some styles of roof can be considered large chhajja as well.
