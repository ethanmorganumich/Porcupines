Casa montañesa
||||||
Casa montañesa is a form of traditional construction of La Montaña in the communities of Cantabria, east of Asturias and northern Castile and León in northern Spain. It should not be confused with casona montañesa, which differs due to its grander style and incorporation of other features.
This housing style developed from the sixteenth through the eighteenth centuries and becoming widely seen by the end of the nineteenth century, when it was popularized by the Spanish architect Leonardo Rucabado. It was widely seen across Cantabria.
