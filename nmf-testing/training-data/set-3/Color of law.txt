Color (law)

In United States law, the term color of law denotes the "mere semblance of legal right," the "pretense or appearance of" right; hence, an action done under color of law adjusts (colors) the law to the circumstance, yet said apparently legal action contravenes the law. Under color of authority is a legal phrase used in North America indicating that a person is claiming or implying the acts they are committing are related to and legitimized by his or her role as an agent of governmental power.
