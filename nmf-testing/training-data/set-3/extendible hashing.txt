Extendible hashing
||||||
Extendible hashing is a type of hash system which treats a hash as a bit string and uses a trie for bucket lookup. Because of the hierarchical nature of the system, re-hashing is an incremental operation (done one bucket at a time, as needed).  This means that time-sensitive applications are less affected by table growth than by standard full-table rehashes.
Extendible hashing was described by Ronald Fagin in 1979. Practically all modern filesystems use either extendible hashing or B-trees. In particular, the Global File System, ZFS, and the SpadFS filesystem use extendible hashing.
