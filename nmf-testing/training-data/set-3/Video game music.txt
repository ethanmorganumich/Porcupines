Video game music (or VGM) is the soundtrack that accompanies video games. Early video game music was once limited to sounds of early sound chips, such as programmable sound generator (PSG) or FM synthesis chips. These limitations have led to the style of music known as chiptune, and became the sound of the first video games.
With advances in technology, video game music has grown to include a larger variety of sounds. Music in video games can be heard over a game's title screen, menus and during gameplay. Game soundtracks can also change depending on a player's actions or situation, such as indicating missed actions in rhythm games, informing the player they are in a dangerous situation or rewarding them for certain achievements.
Video game music can be one of two kinds: original or licensed.The popularity of video game music has created education and job opportunities, generated awards, and led to video game soundtracks to be commercially sold and performed in concerts.
