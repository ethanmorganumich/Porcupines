Looting is the act of stealing, or the taking of goods by force, typically in the midst of a military, political, or other social crisis, such as war, natural disasters (where law and civil enforcement are temporarily ineffective), or rioting.  The proceeds of all these activities can be described as booty, loot, plunder, spoils, or pillage.During modern-day armed conflicts, looting is prohibited by international law, and constitutes a war crime.
