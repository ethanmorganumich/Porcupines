Knee highs
||||||
Knee highs are hosiery that cover the feet and legs up to the knee. A fashion accessory for casual and classic cool or warm weather apparel. Typically worn by women in many societies, they are sometimes worn with modern semi-formal attire. Unlike ordinary socks, they are generally made of nylon or other stocking materials. There were also different types and uses of knee highs for women.Knee highs became popular during the 1960s and 1970s, worn in regular knee high length or top of the knee length so they could be folded over at the top, with the increase in popularity of the mini dress and miniskirt. This style continued throughout the 1980s with above the knee and at the knee length dresses. And in the '80s they were worn not only with boat shoes and flats but also with sneakers that could be worn both dressy or casual. They come in many colors and patterns and transparency levels. They are more popular in cold weather, because they keep the feet and lower legs warm. They are sometimes worn with dresses or skirts whose hemline is below the knee, and with trousers and leggings to keep the feet warm, and with boots to catch perspiration; and sometimes form part of girls' school uniforms.
