In Europe, the United States, and other countries, an Aviation Medical Examiner or Aero-medical Examiner (AME) is a physician designated by the local aviation authority and given the authority to perform flight physical examinations and issue aviation medical certificates. AMEs are practitioners of aviation medicine, although most are also qualified in other medical specialties.
The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) have established basic medical rules for determining whether a pilot or an air traffic controller is fit to act in that capacity, and they are codified in Annex 1 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation. However, most countries' aviation authorities have developed their own specific details and clarifications to be used in addition to – frequently more stringently than – the high-level standards prescribed by ICAO.The military equivalent of the AME is the flight surgeon.
