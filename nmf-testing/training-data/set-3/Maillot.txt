The maillot (UK: ; US: ) is the fashion designer's name for a woman's one-piece swimsuit, also called a tank suit.  A maillot swimsuit generally consists of a tank-style torso top with high-cut legs.  However, a maillot may also include a plunging neckline, turtleneck-style top, or revealing cutouts.In addition to describing women's one-piece swimsuits, the word maillot has also been used to refer to tights or leotards made of stretchable, jersey fabric, generally used for dance or gymnastics. The term maillot was first used to describe tight-fitting, one-piece swimsuits in the 1920s, as these swimsuits had been manufactured from a similar stretchable, jersey fabric.
