Lederhosen (; German pronunciation: [ˈleːdɐˌhoːzn̩], lit. 'leather breeches'; singular in German usage: Lederhose) are short or knee-length leather breeches that are worn as traditional garments in some regions of German-speaking countries. The longer ones are generally called Bundhosen or Kniebundhosen. Once common workwear across Central Europe, these  clothes—or Tracht—are particularly associated with Bavaria and the Tyrol region.
