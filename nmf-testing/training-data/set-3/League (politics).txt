Big League Politics
||||||
Big League Politics is a far-right American media website that promotes conspiracy theories. The website was founded by former Breitbart News employees. The site was announced in 2017 by one of its founders as an investigative outfit. In early 2018, Big League Politics was acquired by Mustard Seed Media which is owned by Reilly O'Neal and Noel Fritsch. The Wall Street Journal describes the website as "a scrappy, pro-Trump outfit backed by Republican operatives".
