Sompot Chong Kben (Khmer: សំពត់ចងក្បិន, sâmpót châng kbĕn  [sɑmput cɑːŋ kɓən]; Thai: โจงกระเบน, RTGS: chong kraben [t͡ɕōːŋ krābēːn]; Lao: ຜ້າຫາງ, pha hang) is a unisex, lower body, wraparound cloth worn in the countries of Cambodia, Laos, and Thailand. It is the preferred choice of clothing for women of upper and middle classes for daily wear. Unlike the typical sompot, it is more of a pant than a skirt. The chong kraben is described by art historian Eksuda Singhalampong as "...a garment that resembles loose breeches. The wearer wraps a rectangular piece of cloth around his [or her] waist, the edge of cloth is then passed between the legs and tucked in at the wearer's lower back. Many 19th-century European accounts often called them knee breeches, riding breeches or knickerbockers.": Note 10
