Haram (; Arabic: حَرَام, ḥarām, [ħaˈraːm]) is an Arabic term meaning 'Forbidden'.: 471  This may refer to either something sacred to which access is not allowed to the people who are not in a state of purity or who are not initiated into the sacred knowledge; or, in direct contrast, to an evil and thus "sinful action that is forbidden to be done". The term also denotes something "set aside", thus being the Arabic equivalent of the Hebrew concept חרם‎, ḥērem and the concept of sacer (cf. sacred) in Roman law and religion. In Islamic jurisprudence, haram is used to refer to any act that is forbidden by God and is one of the five Islamic commandments (Arabic: الأحكام الخمسة, romanized: al-ʾAḥkām al-Ḵamsa) that define the morality of human action.Acts that are haram are typically prohibited in the religious texts of the Quran, and the sunnah category of haram is the highest status of prohibition. If something is considered haram, it remains prohibited no matter how good the intention is or how honorable the purpose is. Sins, good, and meritorious acts are placed on the mizan (weighing scales) on the Day of Judgement and are weighed according to the sincerity of the doer. Views of different madhhabs or legal schools of thought can vary significantly regarding what is or is not haram based on the scholarly interpretation of the core religious texts (Quran and hadith).
