Poodle skirt
||||||
A poodle skirt is a wide swing felt skirt of a solid color displaying a design appliqu√©d or transferred to the fabric. The design was often a coiffed poodle. Later substitutes for the poodle patch included flamingoes, flowers, and hot rod cars. Hemlines were to the knee or just below it. It quickly became very popular with teenage girls, who wore them at school dances, and as everyday wear.
