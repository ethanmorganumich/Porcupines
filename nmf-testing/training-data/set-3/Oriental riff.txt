Oriental riff
||||||
The Oriental riff, also known as the East Asian riff and the Chinaman lick, is a musical riff or phrase that has often been used in Western culture as a trope to represent the idea of China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Vietnam or a generic East Asian theme. It has also been used to represent generic Southeast Asian themes like those from Thailand, Cambodia, Myanmar, and the Philippines. The riff is sometimes accompanied by the sound of a gong.
