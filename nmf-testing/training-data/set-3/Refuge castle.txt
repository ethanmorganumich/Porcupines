Castles by type~

Refuge castle
||||||
A refuge castle or refuge fort (German: Fliehburg, also Fluchtburg, Volksburg, Bauernburg or Vryburg) is a castle-like defensive location, usually surrounded by ramparts, that is not permanently occupied but acts as a temporary retreat for the local population when threatened by war or attack. In former times such sites were also described as giant castles (German: HÃ¼nenburgen) because their origin was ascribed to giants.
