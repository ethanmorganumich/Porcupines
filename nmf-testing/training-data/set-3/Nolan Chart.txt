Nolan Chart
||||||
The Nolan Chart is a political spectrum diagram created by American libertarian activist David Nolan in 1969, charting  political views along two axes, representing economic freedom and personal freedom. It expands political view analysis beyond the traditional one-dimensional leftâ€“right/progressive-conservative divide, positioning libertarianism outside the traditional spectrum.
