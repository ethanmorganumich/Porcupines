AutoLISP
||||||
AutoLISP is a dialect of the programming language Lisp built specifically for use with the full version of AutoCAD and its derivatives, which include AutoCAD Map 3D, AutoCAD Architecture and AutoCAD Mechanical. Neither the application programming interface (API) nor the interpreter to execute AutoLISP code are included in the AutoCAD LT product line. A subset of AutoLISP functions is included in the browser-based AutoCAD web app.
