Drum kit
||||||
A drum kit (also called a drum set, trap set, or simply drums) is a collection of drums, cymbals, and other auxiliary percussion instruments set up to be played by one person. The player (drummer) typically holds a pair of matching drumsticks, one in each hand, and uses their feet to operate a foot-controlled hi-hat and bass drum pedal.  
A standard kit may contain:
A snare drum, mounted on a stand
A bass drum, played with a beater moved by a foot-operated pedal
One or more tom-toms, including rack toms and/or floor toms
One or more cymbals, including a ride cymbal and crash cymbal
Hi-hat cymbals, a pair of cymbals that can be manipulated by a foot-operated pedal
The drum kit is a part of the standard rhythm section and is used in many types of popular and traditional music styles, ranging from rock and pop to blues and jazz.
