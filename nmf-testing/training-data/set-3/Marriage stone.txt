Marriage stone
||||||
A marriage stone, nuptial stone or lintel stone is usually a stone, rarely wood, lintel carved with the initials, coat of arms, etc. of a newly married couple, usually displaying the date of the marriage. They were very popular until Victorian times, but fell out of general use in the 20th century. Many survive for aesthetic value, particularly where well carved or of historic value. Many are part of or in the grounds of a listed building or in conservation areas.
