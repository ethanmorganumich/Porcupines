Ukrainian wreath
||||||
Ukrainian wreath (Ukrainian: вінок, vinók), or Vinok, is a type of wreath which, in traditional Ukrainian culture, is worn by girls and young unmarried women.  The wreath may be part of a tradition dating back to the old East Slavic customs that predate the Christianization of Rus. The flower wreath remains a part of the Ukrainian national attire, and is worn on festive occasions and on holy days, and since the 2014 Ukrainian revolution increasingly in daily life as part of a wider cultural revival.
