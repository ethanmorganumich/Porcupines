Rekel

Rekel(Yiddish: רעקל) or lang rekel (plural rekelech) is a type of frock coat worn mainly by Hasidic Jewish men during the Jewish work-week (Sunday-Friday). Though the rekel was intended for weekday use, some Hasidim wear one on Shabbat. A more formal coat, considered by many as a more proper Shabbat garment, is called a bekishe in Hungarian. A bekishe is usually made of polyester or silk.
By way of comparison, The New York Times described the Bekeshe as a "fancier Sabbath version" of the Rekel.
