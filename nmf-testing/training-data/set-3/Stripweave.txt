Stripweave is a textile technique in which large numbers of thin strips of cloth are sewn together to produce a finished fabric.  Most stripweave is produced in West Africa from handwoven fabric, of which the example best known internationally is the kente cloth of Ghana.The earliest evidence of this traditional technique dates to the eleventh century among the Tellem people of Mali.
