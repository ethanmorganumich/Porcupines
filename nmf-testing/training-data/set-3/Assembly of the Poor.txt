Assembly of the Poor
||||||
The Assembly of the Poor (Thai: สมัชชาคนจน) (AOP) is a non-governmental organization (NGO) in Thailand. Its aim is to help those affected by development projects and industries to become involved in the process of development, so that they benefit from those projects.
The Assembly of the Poor is intended to be a political voice for villagers and marginalized members of society.  As an organization, it is allied with other NGOs in Thailand.  When the Assembly of the Poor first began, it was accused of dismantling Thailand's unity and the democratic principles of Thai ideologies. The non-governmental organization is an amalgamation of seven districts representing every region of Thailand. It is composed of urban and rural small-scale agriculturists and manual labourers. Due to its variety of members, the Assembly is able to transcend regional and class divisions.
