Drum rudiment

In rudimental drumming, a form of percussion music, a drum rudiment is one of a number of relatively small patterns which form the foundation for more extended and complex drumming patterns. The term "drum rudiment" is most closely associated with various forms of field drumming, where the snare drum plays a prominent role. In this context "rudiment"  means not only "basic", but also fundamental. This tradition of drumming originates in military drumming and it is a central component of martial music.
