In music, a reprise ( rə-PREEZ, French: [ʁəpʁiz] (listen); from the verb reprendre 'to resume') is the repetition or reiteration of the opening material later in a composition as occurs in the recapitulation of sonata form, though—originally in the 18th century—was simply any repeated section, such as is indicated by beginning and ending repeat signs.A partial or abbreviated reprise is known as a petite reprise ( pə-TEET rə-PREEZ, French: [p(ə)tit ʁəpʁiz]). In Baroque music this usually occurs at the very end of a piece, repeating the final phrase with added ornamentation.
