Reckless driving
||||||
In United States law, reckless driving is a major moving traffic violation that generally consists in driving a vehicle with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of persons or property. It is usually a more serious offense than careless driving, improper driving, or driving without due care and attention and is often punishable by fines, imprisonment, or driver's license suspension or revocation. In Commonwealth countries, the offense of dangerous driving applies. 
Reckless driving has been studied by psychologists who found that reckless drivers score high in risk-taking personality traits. However, no one cause can be assigned to the mental state.
Depending on the jurisdiction, reckless driving may be defined by a particular subjective mental state that is evident from the circumstances, or by particular driver actions regardless of mental state, or both.
