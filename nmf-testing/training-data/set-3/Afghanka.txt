The Afghanka (Russian: Афганка) (proper designation: M88) is a type of military uniform system developed and issued by the Soviet Army in the early 1980s, still in use today in some Post-Soviet states in many different variants. The name Afghanka is an unofficial popular slang term in Russian for the uniform, derived from its prolific use during the Soviet–Afghan War. All the non-sand coloured versions of the M88 are not called Afghanka.
They are typically made of cotton (Russian: хлопчатая бумага or "Х/б", "cotton paper").
