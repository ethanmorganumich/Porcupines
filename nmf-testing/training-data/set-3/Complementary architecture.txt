Complementary architecture
||||||
Complementary architecture is a movement in contemporary architecture promoting architectural practice rooted in comprehensive understanding of context, aiming to contribute to the environment in such a way as to continue and improve or emphasise its preexisting qualities. Indispensable features of complementary architecture include sustainability, altruism, contextualism, endemism and continuity of specific regional design language.The word complement has roots in the Latin complementum, from complÄ“re to fill up, complete and remains true to that origin in its spelling and in its meanings that have to do with completing or fulfilment.Complementary architecture occurs at the intersection of local pattern and design languages. A pattern language represents a set of more or less formalised rules of human interaction with built forms, resulting from practical solutions developed over time according to local culture and natural conditions. A design language in architecture is a set of geometrical (formal) and material standards used in buildings and other man-made structures, traditionally arising from local materials and their physical properties.Complementary architecture interprets the Vitruvian triad for contemporary use, mapping durability (firmitas) against aspects of broader sustainability, utility (utilitas) against altruism and service to society, and individual beauty (venustas) against harmony with broader context, regional identity and spirit of place.
