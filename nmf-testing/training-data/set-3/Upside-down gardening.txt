Upside-down gardening
||||||
Upside-down gardening is a kitchen garden technique where the vegetable garden uses suspended soil and seedlings to stop pests and blight, and eliminate the typical gardening tasks of tilling, weeding, and staking plants. The vegetable growing yield is only marginally affected. Kathi (Lael) Morris was the first known to grow tomatoes and peppers this way, starting in 1998. Since then, the concept gained tremendous popularity.  Ms. Morris grew mostly heirloom varieties, researching over a span of 11 years, which varieties were compact enough to produce fruit in abundance with little or no breakage of the stems. Traditional horticulture experts are curious whether upside-down gardening is a fad as "traditionalist gardening snobs" say or not.
