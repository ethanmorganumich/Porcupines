British ballet
||||||
British ballet is most recognised for two leading methods, those of the Royal Ballet School and the Royal Academy of Dance.  The identifying characteristic of British ballet is the focus on clean, precise technique and purity of line that is free of exaggeration and mannerisms.  The training of dancers in Britain is noted for its slow progression, with a great deal of attention paid to basic technique.  British ballet methods operate on the principle that establishing correct technique and strength slowly makes it much easier for the student to adapt to more difficult vocabulary and techniques later on.
