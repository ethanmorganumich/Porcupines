Yellow-dog contract
||||||
A yellow-dog contract (a yellow-dog clause of a contract, also known as an ironclad oath) is an agreement between an employer and an employee in which the employee agrees, as a condition of employment, not to be a member of a labor union.  In the United States, such contracts were, until the 1930s, widely used by employers to prevent the formation of unions, most often by permitting employers to take legal action against union organizers.  In 1932, yellow-dog contracts were outlawed in the United States under the Norris-LaGuardia Act.
