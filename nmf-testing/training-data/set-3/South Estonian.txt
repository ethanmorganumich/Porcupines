South Estonian

South Estonian is spoken in south-eastern Estonia, encompassing the Tartu, Mulgi, Võro and Seto varieties. There is no academic consensus on its status, as some linguists consider South Estonian a dialect group of Estonian whereas other linguists consider South Estonian an independent Finnic language. Diachronically speaking, North and South Estonian are separate branches of the Finnic languages.Modern standard Estonian has evolved on the basis of the dialects of Northern Estonia. However, from the 17th to 19th century in Southern Estonia, literature was published in a standardized form of Southern Tartu and Northern Võro. This usage was called Tartu or literary South Estonian. The written standard was used in the schools, churches and courts of the Võro and Tartu linguistic area but not in the Seto and Mulgi areas.
After Estonia gained independence in 1918, the standardized Estonian language policies were implemented further throughout the country. The government officials during the era believed that the Estonian state needed to have one standard language for all its citizens which led to the exclusion of South Estonian in education. The ban on the instruction and use of South Estonian dialects in schools continued during Soviet occupation (1940–1990).Since Estonia regained independence in 1991, the Estonian government has become more supportive of the protection and development of South Estonian. A modernized literary form founded on the Võro dialect of South Estonian has been sanctioned.
