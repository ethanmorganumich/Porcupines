Suede

Suede (pronounced  SWAYD) is a type of leather with a fuzzy, napped finish, commonly used for jackets, shoes, fabrics, purses, furniture, and other items. The term comes from the French gants de Su√®de, which literally means "gloves from Sweden". The term was first used by The Oxford English Dictionary in 1884. 
Suede is made from the underside of the animal skin, which is softer and more pliable than the outer skin layer, though not as durable.
