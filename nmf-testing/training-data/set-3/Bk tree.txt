BK-tree
||||||
A BK-tree is a metric tree suggested by Walter Austin Burkhard and Robert M. Keller[1] specifically adapted to discrete metric spaces.
For simplicity, consider integer discrete metric 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        x
        ,
        y
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(x,y)}
  . Then, BK-tree is defined in the following way. An arbitrary element a is selected as root node.  The root node may have zero or more subtrees.  The k-th subtree is recursively built of all elements b such that 
  
    
      
        d
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
        =
        k
      
    
    {\displaystyle d(a,b)=k}
  . BK-trees can be used for approximate string matching in a dictionary.[2]
