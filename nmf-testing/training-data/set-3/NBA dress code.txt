NBA dress code
||||||
The National Basketball Association's (NBA) dress code was introduced originally on October 17, 2005 under NBA commissioner David Stern. The mandatory dress code for all NBA and NBA Development League players was especially noteworthy because it made the NBA the first major professional sports league to implement such rules, although National Hockey League rules previously stated that a player is supposed to wear a jacket and tie to games and on charters if not told otherwise by the head coach or general manager. The dress code went into effect at the start of the 2005â€“06 NBA season.
