Promenade concert

Promenade concerts were musical performances in the 18th and 19th century pleasure gardens of London, where the audience would stroll about while listening to the music. The term derives from the French se promener, "to walk".
Today, the term promenade concert is often associated with the Proms summer classical music concert series founded in 1895 by Robert Newman and the conductor Henry Wood.
