Declaration of mailing
||||||
A declaration of mailing is a legal form verifying that a document has been sent via mail to a third party, usually required to be sent with documents as proof to a judge or clerk that a set of documents has been mailed. This may be to an individual or group, or attorneys relating to a particular issue. It requires that legally once signed a document has been sent; and if broken the sending party may be liable to charges of perjury or contempt of court.
The document is usually a short form with the following indicated information:

Business address or contact address; sometimes telephone and fax numbers.
Name and signature of mailer.
Names of documents attached.
Names of parties or attorneys sent to.
