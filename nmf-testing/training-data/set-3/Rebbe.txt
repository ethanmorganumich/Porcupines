A Rebbe (Yiddish: רבי, romanized: rebe) or Admor (Hebrew: אדמו״ר) is the spiritual leader in the Hasidic movement, and the personalities  of its dynasties. The titles of Rebbe and Admor, which used to be a general honor title even before the beginning of the movement, became, over time, almost exclusively identified with its Tzaddikim.
