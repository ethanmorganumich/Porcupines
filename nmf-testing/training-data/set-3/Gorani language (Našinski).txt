The Gorani ([ɡɔ̌rani], Cyrillic: Горани) or Goranci ([ɡɔrǎːntsi], Cyrillic: Горанци), are a Slavic Muslim ethnic group inhabiting the Gora region—the triangle between Kosovo, Albania, and North Macedonia. They number an estimated 60,000 people, and speak a transitional South Slavic dialect, called Goranski. The vast majority of the Gorani people adhere to Sunni Islam.
