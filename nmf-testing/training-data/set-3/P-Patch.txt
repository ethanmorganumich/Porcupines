P-Patch
||||||
A P-Patch is a parcel of property used for gardening; the term is specific to Seattle, Washington. The "P" originally stood for "Picardo", after the family who owned Picardo Farm in Seattle's Wedgwood neighborhood, part of which became the original P-Patch. (A folk etymology attributes it to "pea patch".)
One of the more unique P-Patch locations is atop the Mercer Street parking garage at the Seattle Center, which has 25,000 square feet (2,300 m2). It opened in 2012 and was slated for closure in 2020, but was saved after community protests.
