||||||
A kebaya is an upper garment traditionally worn by women in Southeast Asia, notably in Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Southern Thailand. Outside of Southeast Asia, it is worn by Javanese, Malays and Portuguese Eurasians in Australian Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, coastal India and Sri Lanka, Macau as well as South Africa.
Kebaya is an upper garment opened at the front traditionally made from lightweight fabrics such as brocade, cotton, gauze, lace, or voile, sometimes adorned with embroidery. The front is secured with either buttons, pins, or brooches. The lower garment for the outfit is known as sarong, kemben or kain, a long piece of cloth wrapped and tucked around the waist or under the armpits, either made out of batik, ikat, songket or tenun.
Kebaya is officially recognised as the national costume of Indonesia, and its fashion icon, although it is more popularly worn by Javanese, Sundanese and Balinese people. In Malaysia, Singapore and Brunei, it is recognised as one of its ethnic costumes especially among Malay and Peranakan communities, the complete outfit is known in these region as "sarong kebaya". The style of sarong kebaya vary from place to place throughout the region.
Kebaya has become a Southeast Asian fashion icon, with many Southeast Asian flag carrier airlines including Singapore Airlines, Malaysia Airlines, Royal Brunei Airlines and Garuda Indonesia have adopted the traditional clothing as the uniforms for their female flight attendants.
