Pruning shears
||||||
Pruning shears, also called hand pruners (in American English), or secateurs (in British English), are a type of scissors for use on plants.  They are strong enough to prune hard branches of trees and shrubs, sometimes up to two centimetres thick.  They are used in gardening, arboriculture, plant nursery works, farming, flower arranging, and nature conservation, where fine-scale habitat management is required.
Loppers are a larger, two-handed, long-handled version for branches thicker than pruning shears can cut.
