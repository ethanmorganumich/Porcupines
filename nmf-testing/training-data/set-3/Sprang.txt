Sprang
||||||
Sprang is an ancient method of constructing fabric that has a natural elasticity.  Its appearance is similar to netting, but unlike netting sprang is constructed entirely from warp threads.  Archaeological evidence indicates that sprang predates knitting; the two needlework forms bear a visible resemblance and serve similar functions but require different production techniques.
Although examples of sprang have been unearthed from as early as the Bronze Age, sprang was almost entirely undocumented in written records until the late nineteenth century when archaeological finds generated interest in Europe.  Museum examples of sprang had been misidentified as knitting or lace until discoveries of ancient examples prompted reexamination of newer pieces.  Subsequently, sprang has been identified in a variety of cultures and traditions across several continents.  Its practice as a folk art waned during the twentieth century and sprang traditions have disappeared in most locales.  Knitting has largely supplanted sprang.
