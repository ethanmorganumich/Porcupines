European medieval architecture in North America

Medieval architecture in North America is an anachronism. Some structures in North America can however be classified as medieval, either by age or origin. In some rare cases these structures are seen as evidence on pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact. Although much of this is pseudoscience, these buildings are of interest to American scholars of medieval architecture.
