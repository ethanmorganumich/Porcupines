Social liberalism (German: Sozialliberalismus, Spanish: socioliberalismo, Dutch: Sociaalliberalisme), also known as new liberalism in the United Kingdom, modern liberalism, or simply liberalism in the contemporary United States, left-liberalism (German: Linksliberalismus) in Germany, and progressive liberalism (Spanish: Liberalismo progresista) in Spanish-speaking countries, is a political philosophy and variety of liberalism that endorses a social market economy and the expansion of civil and political rights. Social liberalism views the common good as harmonious with the individual's freedom. Social liberals overlap with social democrats in accepting economic intervention more than other liberals, although its importance is considered auxiliary compared to social democrats. Ideologies that emphasize only the economic policy of social liberalism include welfare liberalism, New Deal liberalism in the United States, and Keynesian liberalism. Cultural liberalism is an ideology that highlights only the cultural aspects of social liberalism. The world has widely adopted social liberal policies.Social liberal ideas and parties tend to be considered centrist or centre-left. Addressing economic and social issues such as poverty, welfare, infrastructure, health care, education, and the climate using government intervention while emphasising individual rights and autonomy are expectations under a social liberal government. In the United States, social liberalism may sometimes refer to progressive stances on sociocultural issues, such as reproductive rights and same-sex marriage, in contrast with social conservatism. Cultural liberalism is also often referred to as social liberalism because it expresses the social dimension of liberalism. However, it is not the same as the broader political ideology known as social liberalism. In American politics, a social liberal may hold either conservative (economic liberal) or liberal (economic progressive) views on fiscal policy.
