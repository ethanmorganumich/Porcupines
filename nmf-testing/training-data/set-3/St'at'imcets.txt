Lillooet language
||||||
Lillooet , known in the language itself as St̓át̓imcets / Sƛ̓aƛ̓imxǝc ([ˈst͡ɬʼæt͡ɬʼjəmxət͡ʃ]), is the language of the St’át’imc, a Salishan language of the Interior branch spoken in southern British Columbia, Canada, around the middle Fraser and Lillooet Rivers.  The language of the Lower Lillooet people uses the name Ucwalmícwts, because St̓át̓imcets means "the language of the people of Sat̓", i.e. the Upper Lillooet of the Fraser River.
Lillooet is an endangered language with as few as 200 native speakers practically all of whom are over 60 years of age (Gordon 2005).
