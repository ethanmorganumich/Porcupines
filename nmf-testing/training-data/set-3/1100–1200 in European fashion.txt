1100â€“1200 in European fashion
||||||
Twelfth century European fashion was simple and differed only in details from the clothing of the preceding centuries.  Men wore knee-length tunics for most activities, and men of the upper classes wore long tunics, with hose and 
mantle or cloaks.  Women wore long tunics or dresses.  A close fit to the body, full skirts, and long flaring sleeves were characteristic of upper-class fashion for both men and women.
