Beoseon
||||||
The beoseon (Korean pronunciation: [pʌ.sʌn]) is a type of paired socks worn with hanbok, Korean traditional clothing and is made for protection, warmth, and style. It is also called jokui (족의, 足衣), jokgeon (족건, 足件) or mal (말, 襪) in hanja. According to a book titled Hunmong jahoe (훈몽자회,訓蒙字會) written by Choe Sejin (최세진,崔世珍) in 1527 during the reign of King Jungjong of the Joseon Dynasty (1392 - 1910), beoseon was called "bosyeonmal" (보션말), so it may be called by the name before the time.It is not clear when beoseon first began to be worn, but ancient beoseon is assumed to be a form extended from a trouser or bojagi (wrapping clothes) for protecting the foot. During the period of the Three Kingdoms of Korea (57 BC – 668 AD), beonseon made of silk was worn but it was limited by social class. In the Joseon period, beoseon made of a white fabric was usually worn regardless of class except special occasions.
