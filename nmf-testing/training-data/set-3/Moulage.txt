Moulage
||||||
Moulage (French for 'casting, moulding') is the art of applying mock injuries for the purpose of training emergency response teams and other medical and military personnel.  Moulage may be as simple as applying pre-made rubber or latex "wounds" to a healthy "patient's" limbs, chest, head, etc., or as complex as using makeup and theatre techniques to provide elements of realism (such as blood, vomitus, open fractures, etc.) to the training simulation.  The practice dates to at least the Renaissance, when wax figures were used for this purpose.In Germany some universities and hospitals use their historical moulage collections for the training of students. The often very lifelike models are especially useful to show the students today the characteristics of rare diseases, such as skin tuberculosis or leprosy.
