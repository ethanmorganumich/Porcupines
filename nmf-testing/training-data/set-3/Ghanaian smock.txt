Ghanaian smock
||||||
A Ghanaian smock is a plaid shirt that is similar to the dashiki, worn by both women and men in Ghana. It is the most popular traditional attire in Ghana. The smock is called Bingmaa in Dagbani language, Bun-nwâ†ƒ or Bana by Mamprusis, fugu in Mosi,  batakari in the southern regions, dansika in Frafra, and Banaa in Kusaal both in the upper east region. It is worn by Royals and civilians across Dagbon and other northern regions, but popular across Ghana. The smock originated in the northern region of Ghana but widely used in West Africa and diasporans across the world. The smock is not unlike the national attire of Burkina Faso known as faso dan fadi.
The smock and Kente cloth are the national dress of Ghana. Kente cloth originated in the southern region of Ghana.
The smock is made of hand-loomed strips popularly called Strip Cloths. They are made  of a mixture of dyed and undyed cotton loom, and are originally from the northern part of Ghana and other parts of West Africa.  The strips are sewn together by hand or machine giving the smock a plaid appearance.  
Most smocks have embroidery on the neckline.  The smock is worn with a kufi cap. However, chiefs in Ghana wear the smock with a red fez hat.
