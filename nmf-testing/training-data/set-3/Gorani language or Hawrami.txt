Gorani (Kurdish: گۆرانی, romanized: Goranî, lit. 'song') also known by its main dialect; Hawrami (ھەورامی, romanized: Hewramî) is a Northwestern Iranian language spoken by ethnic Kurds and which with Zazaki constitute the Zaza–Gorani languages. All the Gorani dialects are influenced by Kurdish lexically and morphologically. Gorani is considered a Kurdish dialect by many researchers. Some consider it a literary language for Kurds, and the speakers of Gorani call their language "Kurdish"Gorani has four dialects: Bajelani, Hawrami, Sarli and Shabaki and is spoken in Iraq and Iran. Of these, Hawrami was the traditional literary language and koiné of Kurds in the historical Ardalan region at the Zagros Mountains, but has since been supplanted by Central Kurdish and Southern Kurdish.
