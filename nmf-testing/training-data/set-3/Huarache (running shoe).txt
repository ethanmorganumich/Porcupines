Huarache (running shoe)

Huaraches are an open type of outdoor footwear, consisting of a sole held to the wearer's foot by straps passing over the instep and around the ankle. The common understanding is that these sandals were a variant of traditional Mexican huaraches, the difference being in design and construction.These sandals are favoured by minimalist runners for several reasons. They force the foot and the runner to run with a natural gait. They also help protect the foot from glass, gravel, and other debris.In Christopher McDougall's book Born to Run the author describes the Rar√°muri of the Mexican Copper Canyons teaching a fellow runner how to build huaraches.
