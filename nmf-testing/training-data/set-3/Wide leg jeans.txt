Wide-leg jeans
||||||
Wide-leg jeans, colloquially called baggy pants, are a style of clothing that were popular from the early 1990s to the early 2010s. The quintessential brand of "hip-hop"-style wide-leg jeans comes from the Los Angelesâ€“based JNCO ("Judge None Choose One"), although other youth- and ethnic-oriented clothing companies manufacture them as well.
