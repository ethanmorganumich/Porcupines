Islamic dietary laws
||||||
Islamic dietary laws are dietary laws that Muslims follow. Islamic jurisprudence specifies which foods are halāl (حَلَال, "lawful") and which are harām (حَرَامْ, "unlawful"). The dietary laws are found in the Quran, the holy book of Islam, as well as in collections of traditions attributed to Islamic prophet Muhammad.
Herbivores or cud-chewing animals like cattle, deer, sheep, goats, and antelope are some examples of animals that are halal and only if they are treated like sentient beings and slaughtered painlessly while reciting the Bismillah and Takbir. If the animal is treated poorly, or tortured while being slaughtered, the meat is haram. Forbidden food substances include alcohol, pork, carrion, the meat of carnivores and animals that died due to illness, injury, stunning, poisoning, or slaughtering not in the name of God.
