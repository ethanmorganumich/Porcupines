MetaCrawler
||||||
MetaCrawler is a search engine. It is a registered trademark of InfoSpace and was created by Erik Selberg.
It was originally a metasearch engine, as its name suggests. Throughout its lifetime it combined web search results from sources including Google, Yahoo!, Bing (formerly Live Search), Ask.com, About.com, MIVA, LookSmart and other search engine programs. MetaCrawler also provided users the option to search for images, video, news, business and personal telephone directories, and for a while even audio.
