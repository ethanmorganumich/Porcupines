A couplet is a pair of successive lines of metre in poetry.  A couplet usually consists of two successive lines that rhyme and have the same metre. A couplet may be formal (closed) or run-on (open).  In a formal (or closed) couplet, each of the two lines is end-stopped, implying that there is a grammatical pause at the end of a line of verse.  In a run-on (or open) couplet, the meaning of the first line continues to the second.
