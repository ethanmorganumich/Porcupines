Neck corset
||||||
A neck corset (sometimes called corset collar or neck lacer) is a type of BDSM collar. Unlike a normal corset which compresses the waist, a neck corset is usually not used to compress the neck, except in breathplay. It may act as a posture collar that incorporates stays.
Neck corsets may be worn in BDSM and goth subcultures, and may be worn in a decorative fashion or as a form of fetish clothing.
