||||||
A kashket (Yiddish: קאַשקעט, from Polish  kaszkiet and Ukrainian  кашкет; from French  casquette 'cap'; also known as a kashkettel or kasket) is a cap, usually made of felt, worn mainly by Hasidic Jewish children as an alternative to the kippah. It has a crown, a band and peak. From the beginning of the 20th century until World War II, many Russian Jews and Polish Jews wore this cap as part of their everyday dress.
