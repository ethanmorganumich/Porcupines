Fortochka
||||||
A fortochka (Russian: фо́рточка, IPA: [ˈfortətɕkə] (listen)) is a small ventilation window. It usually spans the frame of one window pane and opens on hinges independently of the whole window. Fortochkas are  in common use in Russia, other post-Soviet states (Ukrainian: кватирка, kvatyrka), and Finland (Finnish: tuuletusikkuna).
A fortochka can be used for ventilation during cold winters, when opening a whole window would be impractical for heat conservation purposes.
