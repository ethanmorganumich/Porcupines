Sharawadji effect
||||||
The sharawadji effect is a musical perception or phenomenon regarding timbre and texture described by Claude Shryer as "a sensation of plenitude sometimes created by the contemplation of a complex soundscape whose beauty is inexplicable." Sharawadji is not a stimulus, but rather a reaction to a stimulus. Shryer described searching for this "state of awareness" by "tend[ing] an open ear in the hopes of experiencing the sublime beauty of a given sound in an unexpected context." The experience of the sharawadji sonic effect is often heavily dictated by personal context as well as the perception of the listener. One example of this effect is the appreciation of the sound of rumbling thunder: those who are directly exposed to the elements would be more likely to fear it compared to those who experience the sound while in a safe environment. Simply understood, "sharawadji sounds belong to everyday life, to a known musical style. They become sharawadji only through decontextualization, through a rupture of meaning."
