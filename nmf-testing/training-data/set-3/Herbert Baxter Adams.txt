Herbert Baxter Adams (April 16, 1850 â€“ July 30, 1901) was an American educator and historian who  brought German rigor to the study of history in America; a founding member of the American History Association; and one of the earliest educators using the seminar for teaching history. With a fresh PhD from the University of Heidelberg in Germany, Johns Hopkins University brought Adams in as a teaching fellow in history during their inaugural year. Adams stayed with Johns Hopkins until his health failed.
