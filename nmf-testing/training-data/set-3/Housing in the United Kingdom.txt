Housing in the United Kingdom
||||||
Housing in the United Kingdom represents the largest non-financial asset class in the UK; its overall net value passed the Â£5 trillion mark in 2014.  About 30% of homes are owned outright by their occupants, and a further 40% are owner-occupied on a mortgage.  About 18% are social housing of some kind, and the remaining 12% are privately rented.The UK ranks in the top half of European countries with regard to rooms per person, amenities, and quality of housing. However, the cost of housing as a proportion of income is higher than average among said countries, and the increasing cost of housing in the UK may constitute a housing crisis for some, especially for those in low income brackets or in high-cost areas such as London.Housing is the jurisdiction of the Minister of State for Housing.
