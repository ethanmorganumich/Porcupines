Louis XV style

The Louis XV style or Louis Quinze (, French: [lwi kɛ̃z]) is a style of architecture and decorative arts which appeared during the reign of Louis XV. From 1710 until about 1730, a period known as the Régence, it was largely an extension of the Louis XIV style of his great-grandfather and predecessor, Louis XIV. From about 1730 until about 1750, it became more original, decorative and exuberant, in what was known as the Rocaille style, under the influence of the King's mistress, Madame de Pompadour.  It marked the beginning of the European Rococo movement.  From 1750 until the King's death in 1774, it became more sober, ordered, and began to show the influences of Neoclassicism.
