Pushdown automaton

In the theory of computation, a branch of theoretical computer science, a pushdown automaton (PDA) is   
a type of automaton that employs a stack.
Pushdown automata are used in theories about what can be computed by machines. They are more capable than finite-state machines but less capable than Turing machines (see below).
Deterministic pushdown automata can recognize all deterministic context-free languages while nondeterministic ones can recognize all context-free languages, with the former often used in parser design.
The term "pushdown" refers to the fact that the stack can be regarded as being "pushed down" like a tray dispenser at a cafeteria, since the operations never work on elements other than the top element.  A stack automaton, by contrast, does allow access to and operations on deeper elements.  Stack automata can recognize a strictly larger set of languages than pushdown automata.
A nested stack automaton allows full access, and also allows stacked values to be entire sub-stacks rather than just single finite symbols.
