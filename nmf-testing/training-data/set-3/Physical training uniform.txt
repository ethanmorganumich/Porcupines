Physical training uniform
||||||
A physical training uniform is a military uniform used during exercise, calisthenics, drills, and in some cases, very casual periods of time (off-duty time during Initial Entry Training in the U.S. Army, for example). Most militaries, especially the United States Armed Forces and their auxiliaries (e.g. ROTC and JROTC components) require use of a physical training (PT) uniform during unit exercise (including formation runs, calisthenics, and conditioning exercises). All items worn by military personnel conducting PT as a group are subject to uniformity, at commander discretions, however, some U.S. military units produce unique T-shirts with their unit insignia and motto, and for special events, this shirt is part of the uniform. Occasionally, exercise will also be conducted in that branch's utility uniforms, normally with the blouse removed and the undershirt exposed (also known as "boots and utes" ). For unit runs, esprit de corps or special occasions, commanders may have personnel wear unique T-shirts with the distinctive unit insignia and unit colors.
