Sweatpants are a casual variety of soft trousers intended for comfort or athletic purposes, although they are now worn in many different situations. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa they are known as tracksuit bottoms. In Australia and New Zealand, they are also commonly known as trackpants, trackies, tracky daks or joggers. In the Philippines, they are called "jogging pants".
