Sustain pedal
||||||
A sustain pedal or sustaining pedal (also called damper pedal, loud pedal, or open pedal) is the most commonly used pedal in a modern piano. It is typically the rightmost of two or three pedals. When pressed, the sustain pedal "sustains" all the damped strings on the piano by moving all the dampers away from the strings and allowing them to vibrate freely.  All notes played will continue to sound until the vibration naturally ceases, or until the pedal is released.
This lets the pianist sustain notes that would otherwise be out of reach, for instance in accompanying chords, and accomplish legato passages (smoothly connected notes) that would have no possible fingering otherwise. Pressing the sustain pedal also causes all the strings to vibrate sympathetically with whichever notes are being played, which greatly enriches the piano's tone.
