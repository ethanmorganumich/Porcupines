Pile weave
||||||
Pile weave is a form of textile created by weaving. This type of fabric is characterized by a pileâ€”a looped or tufted surface that extends above the initial foundation, or 'ground' weave. The pile is formed by supplemental yarn running in the direction of the length of the fabric (warp pile weave) or the width of the fabric (weft or filling pile weave). Pile weaves include velvet and corduroy fabrics and machine-woven Berber carpets.
