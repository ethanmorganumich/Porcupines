Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom
||||||
Police uniforms and equipment in the United Kingdom have varied considerably from the inception of what were the earliest recognisable mainstream police services in the early 19th century. As various laws in the mid-19th century standardised policing in the United Kingdom, the uniforms and equipment become standardised. From a variety of home grown uniforms, bicycles, swords and pistols the British police force evolved in look and equipment through the long coats and top hat, to the recognisable modern uniform of a white shirt, black tie, reflective jackets, body armour, and the battenburg-marked vehicles, to the present-day Airwave Solutions radios, electric vehicles and tasers.
Police uniform and equipment varies enormously per police force or service and different uniforms and equipment is used for different situations. The lists here are not exhaustive, nor specific for each force, but give a general overview of typical uniform and equipment (colloquially known as 'kit') used in the United Kingdom.
