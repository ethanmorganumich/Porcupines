Index of language articles
||||||
This is a partial index of Wikipedia articles treating natural languages, arranged alphabetically and with (sub-) families mentioned. The list also includes extinct languages.
For a published list of languages, see ISO 639-1 (list of ISO 639-1 codes for 136 major languages), or for a more inclusive list, see ISO 639-3 (list of ISO 639-3 codes, 7,874 in total as of June 2013). The enumeration of languages and dialects can easily be taken into the five-digit range; the Linguasphere Observatory has a database (LS-2010) with more than 32,800 coded entries and more than 70,900 linguistic names.
