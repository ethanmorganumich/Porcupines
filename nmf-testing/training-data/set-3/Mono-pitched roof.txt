Shed roof
||||||
A shed roof, also known variously as a pent roof, lean-to roof, outshot, catslide, skillion roof (in Australia and New Zealand), and, rarely, a mono-pitched roof, is a single-pitched roof surface. This is in contrast to a dual- or multiple-pitched roof.
An outshot or catslide roof is a pitched extension of a main roof similar to a lean-to but an extension of the upper roof.  Some Saltbox homes were created by the addition of such a roof, often at a shallower pitch than the original roof.
