Electric jacket

Electric jackets are jackets which exhibit properties similar to those possessed by electric blankets. They are most commonly used by motorcycle riders when temperatures are low. They usually obtain power for their heating processes through a cord which can be plugged into the motorcycle's electric system. 
An additional socket is installed on the vehicle for that purpose, or if the vehicle has a mobile charger/cigarette lighter receptacle available, then the cord is directly plugged into that socket. Other electric jackets with self-contained power sources are in existence, and are useful for more portable situations where the vehicle's 12 volt supply is not available.
