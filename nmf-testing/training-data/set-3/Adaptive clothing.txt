Adaptive clothing is clothing designed around the needs and abilities of people with varying degrees of disability, including congenital disabilities, acquired disabilities (as the result of an injury, illness or accident) and temporary disabilities, as well as physical disabilities. Adaptive clothing is influenced by factors such as age, disability type(s), level of independence, mobility, and dexterity, as well as whether a person requires help when dressing, such as from a caregiver.Despite common misconception, adaptive clothing is utilised by people with a wide range of disabilities, ranging from wheelchair users and people with more visible disabilities to those whose disabilities are not as visible, but still find themselves limited by the construction of typical clothing. Adaptive design, a core component of adaptive clothing design and construction, proactively addresses these foreseen limitations by adapting clothing to the wearer, benefitting both them and carers or healthcare professionals to be more efficient, as well as preventing potential back and shoulder injuries.
