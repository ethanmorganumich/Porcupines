Syriac sacral music is music in the Syriac language as used in the liturgy of Syriac Christianity.
Historically it is best known from and important for its part in the development of Christian sacred music since Antiquity.
The Syriac churches have a musical system based on ancient principles today known as maqam, there are eight maqams used in the church and these are known as qadmoyo (maqam bayati, maqam ussak), trayono (maqam huseini), tlithoyo (maqam segah, maqam nahawand, maqam kurd), rbi'oyo (maqam rast), hmishoyo (maqam huzam), shtithoyo (maqam ajam), shbi'oyo (maqam saba) and tminoyo (maqam hijaz)  (in order from one to eight). The most predominant works of the Syriac Church's music was collected in an anthology named Beth Gazo (Psalms of the Treasury of Maqams). There are also musical psalms other than this repertoire of 700 psalms, among them are the Fenqitho of the Syriac Orthodox and Maronite Churches, as well as the Khudra of the Church of the East.
