Situated ethics
||||||
Situated ethics, often confused with situational ethics, is a view of applied ethics in which abstract standards from a culture or theory are considered to be far less important than the ongoing processes in which one is personally and physically involved, e.g. climate, ecosystem, etc.  It is one of several theories of ethics within the philosophy of action.
There are also situated theories of economics, e.g. most green economics, and of knowledge, usually based on some situated ethics.  All emphasize the actual physical, geographical, ecological and infrastructural state the actor is in, which determines that actor's actions or range of actions - all deny that there is any one point of view from which to apply standards of or by authority.  This makes such theories unpopular with authority, and popular with those who advocate political decentralisation.
