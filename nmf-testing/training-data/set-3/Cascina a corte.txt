In Italy, cascina a corte (Italian: [kaʃˈʃiːna a kˈkorte]; plural: cascine a corte) refers to a type of rural building traditional of the Po Valley, especially of Lombardy and of some areas of Piedmont and Emilia-Romagna.Also known as cascine lombarde or just cascine, these buildings are reported in the Po Valley at least since the 16th century, even though they became common in the 18th and 19th centuries. In particular, during the Napoleonic era, a number of religious buildings were confiscated and transformed into cascine.
