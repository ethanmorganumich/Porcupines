Garland bearers
||||||
Garlands bearers, typically in the form of small naked putti holding up a continuous garland very large in relation to their size, formed a popular ornamental design in classical arts, from the Greco-Roman world to India, with ramifications as far as China.  In Europe they were revived in the Renaissance, and continued in later periods.
