Kinetic architecture
||||||
Kinetic architecture is a concept through which buildings are designed to allow parts of the structure to move, without reducing overall structural integrity. 
A building's capability for motion can be used just to: enhance its aesthetic qualities; respond to environmental conditions; and/or, perform functions that would be impossible for a static structure.
The possibilities for practical implementations of kinetic architecture increased sharply in the late 20th century due to advances in mechanics, electronics, and robotics.
