Market populism
||||||
Market populism, coined by American journalist and historian Thomas Frank, is the concept that the free market is more democratic than any political democracy. Frank himself does not believe this premise and sets forth arguments against it in his book One Market Under God. The concept received major widespread prominence in the 1990s when it was used to justify the New Economy, which consisted of a long bullish trend, and support for the free market.
