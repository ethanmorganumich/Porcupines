Performative architecture
||||||
Performative architecture is an architecture using digital technologies to challenge the way the built environment is designed.
People move – Architecture stops. People desire – space defines. The designer as a spatial programmer collects movements and desires and releases them into the conception of building. (Anderson, 2011) 4
Building performance is a guiding design principle as an emerging approach to architecture.
Buildings are often viewed as objects that:
• Result from design and construction techniques
• Represent various practices and ideas. 2
The building's characteristics are a reflection between the materials and to how they create the flexibility to the performance, instead of being a building that creates no movement visually or through. Both visually and structurally, the building is moving; the building complements the performance. 1
