Student boilersuit
||||||
Student boilersuit (Swedish studentoverall or studenthalare, Finnish opiskelijahaalari, Canadian Flightsuit or Coveralls or redsuits) are boilersuits widely used for specific events at universities and polytechnics in Sweden, Finland, and Canada. Typically, the suits are procured by the student associations of faculties or programmes. At the major Swedish universities (like Lund or Uppsala) the use of boilersuits is limited to engineering students, however at Stockholm they are also worn by students of other programs, but their use has spread to students in other fields at some of the smaller university colleges. In Finland, boilersuits have also been foremost identified with engineering students, but see extensive use in all of the student organizations of Finnish institutions of higher learning, such as the University of Helsinki and Aalto University.
