Hori hori
||||||
A hori-hori, sometimes referred to as a "soil knife" or a "weeding knife", is a heavy serrated multi-purpose steel blade for gardening jobs such as digging or cutting. The blade is sharp on both sides and comes to a semi-sharp point at the end.
The word hori (ホリ) means "to dig" in Japanese and "hori-hori" is the onomatopoeia for a digging sound. The tool itself is commonly referred to in Japan as a "leisure knife" (レジャーナイフ, rejā naifu) or "Sansai knife" (山菜ナイフ, sansai naifu).
