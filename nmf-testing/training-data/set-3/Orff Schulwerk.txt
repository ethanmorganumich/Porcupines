Orff Schulwerk
||||||
The Orff Schulwerk, or simply the Orff Approach, is a developmental approach used in music education. It combines music, movement, drama, and speech into lessons that are similar to a child's world of play. It was developed by the German composer Carl Orff (1895â€“1982) and colleague Gunild Keetman during the 1920s. Carl Orff worked until the end of his life to continue the development and spread of his teaching method. 
The Orff Approach is now used throughout the world to teach students in a natural and comfortable environment. The term "Schulwerk" is German for (literally) "school work" or "schooling", in this regard in the area of music.
