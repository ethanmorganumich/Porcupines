Adolescence
||||||
Adolescence (from Latin  adolescere 'to mature') is a transitional stage of physical and psychological development that generally occurs during the period from puberty to adulthood (typically corresponding to the age of majority). Adolescence is usually associated with the teenage years, but its physical, psychological or cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later. Puberty now typically begins during preadolescence, particularly in females. Physical growth (particularly in males) and cognitive development can extend past the teens. Age provides only a rough marker of adolescence, and scholars often disagree on the definition and where to place the cutoff. Historically, the term adolescence was often synonymous with youth, or the state of being young. Whereas adolescence is now used mainly to refer to the period starting with the major onset of puberty and ending when one reaches the age of majority, usually corresponding to 18 years of age.  The World Health Organization definition currently designates an adolescent as someone between the ages of 10 and 19.
