Herzog & de Meuron
||||||
Herzog & de Meuron Basel Ltd., is a Swiss architecture firm with its head office in Basel, Switzerland. The careers of founders and senior partners Jacques Herzog (born 19 April 1950) and Pierre de Meuron (born 8 May 1950) closely paralleled one another, with both attending the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich. They are perhaps best known for their conversion of the giant Bankside Power Station in London to the new home of Tate Modern. Jacques Herzog and Pierre de Meuron have been professors at ETH ZÃ¼rich from 1999 until 2018, co-founding ETH Studio Basel in 1999 with architects Roger Diener and Marcel Meili in the department of architecture. Both have been visiting professors at the Harvard University Graduate School of Design, with Jacques Herzog also being a Visiting Tutor at Cornell University College of Architecture, Art and Planning.
