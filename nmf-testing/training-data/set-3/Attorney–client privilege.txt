Attorney–client privilege
||||||
Attorney–client privilege or lawyer–client privilege is the name given to the common law concept of legal professional privilege in the United States.  Attorney–client privilege is "[a] client's right to refuse to disclose and to prevent any other person from disclosing confidential communications between the client and the attorney."The attorney–client privilege is one of the oldest  privileges for confidential communications. The United States Supreme Court has stated that by assuring confidentiality, the privilege encourages clients to make "full and frank" disclosures to their attorneys, who are then better able to provide candid advice and effective representation.
