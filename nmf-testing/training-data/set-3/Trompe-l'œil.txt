Trompe-l'œil
||||||
Trompe-l'œil ( tromp LOY, French: [tʁɔ̃p lœj]; French for 'deceive the eye') is an artistic term for the highly realistic optical illusion of three-dimensional space and objects on a two-dimensional surface. Trompe l'oeil, which is most often associated with painting, tricks the viewer into perceiving painted objects or spaces as real. Forced perspective is a related illusion in architecture.
