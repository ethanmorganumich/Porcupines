Forensic psychology

Forensic psychology involves generating scientific knowledge and clinical techniques to help answer legal questions arising in criminal, civil, contractual, or other judicial cases or scenarios. Forensic psychology includes both research on various psychology-law topics, such as jury selection, psycholegal psychometrics, and eyewitness testimony, as well as professional practice, such as evaluating individuals to determine competency to stand trial or assessing military veterans for service-connected disability compensation. Historically and broadly, this field is known for applying psychological techniques specifically within court systems. Key psychological influencers of this early development included Wilhem Wundt, Hugo MÃ¼nsterberg, and Sigmund Freud among others. Contemporary definitions of forensic psychology recognize that several subfields of psychology apply "the scientific, technical, or specialized knowledge of psychology to the law." While the American Psychological Association (APA) officially recognized forensic psychology as a specialty under the narrower definition in 2001, the Specialty Guidelines for Forensic Psychologists were revised in 2013 and now reference several psychology subdisciplines, such as social, clinical, experimental, counseling, and neuropsychology.
