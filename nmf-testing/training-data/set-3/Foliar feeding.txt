Foliar feeding
||||||
Foliar feeding is a technique of feeding plants by applying liquid fertilizer directly to the leaves. Plants are able to absorb essential elements through their leaves. The absorption takes place through their stomata and also through their epidermis.  Transport is usually faster through the stomata, but total absorption may be as great through the epidermis.  Plants are also able to absorb nutrients through their bark.Foliar feeding was earlier thought to damage tomatoes, but has become standard practice.
