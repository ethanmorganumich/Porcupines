Home economics

Home economics, or family and consumer sciences, is a subject concerning human development, personal and family finances, consumer issues, housing and interior design, nutrition and food preparation, as well as textiles and apparel.Home economics courses are offered around the world and across multiple educational levels. Internationally, it is coordinated by the International Federation for Home Economics (Fédération internationale pour l'économie familiale). Historically, the purpose of these courses was to professionalize housework, to provide intellectual fulfillment for women, and to emphasize the value of "women's work" in society and to prepare them for the traditional roles of sexes. However, it has since evolved into family and consumer sciences to cover additional subject matter outside of just home life and wellness. Family and consumer sciences are taught as an elective or required course in secondary education, as a continuing education course in institutions, and at the primary level.  
Beginning as home economics in the United States, the course was a key part of the education system for teaching one the art of taking care of a household. In the 19th and early 20th century, it was a woman-dominated course, teaching women to be homemakers and efficient household managers. The American Association of Family and Consumer Sciences was created as an answer to more Americans desiring youth to learn vocational skills. Politics played a role in home economics education, and it wasn’t until later in the century that the course shifted from being woman-dominated to now required for both sexes.  
Now family and consumer science have been included in the broader subject of Career Technical Education, a program that teaches skilled trades, applied sciences, modern technologies, and career preparation.  Despite the subjects over the past century, there has been a major decline in home economics courses offered by educational institutions.
