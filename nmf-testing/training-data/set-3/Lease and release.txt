Lease and release
||||||
Lease and release is literally the lease (tenancy) of non-tenanted property by its owner followed by a release (relinquishment) of the landlord's interest in the property.  This sequence of transactions was commonly used to transfer full title to real estate under real property law.  Lease and release was a mode of conveyance of freehold estates formerly common in England and in New York for tax avoidance and speed.  Between its parties it achieves the same outcome as a deed of grant/transfer/conveyance.
