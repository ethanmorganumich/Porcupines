Stackhat
||||||
The Stackhat was a bicycle helmet widely available in Australia in the 1980s. It was originally designed as a generic sport safety helmet by CIG (Commonwealth Industrial Gases, now BOC) and then developed by Rosebank.  Due to government regulations and promotion by various State governments, the sturdy bright orange Stackhat had a near monopoly on bicycle helmets in the country for teenagers and children. Its distinctive design, initial release in a bright orange colour, ubiquitous ownership in the 1980s, and fast disappearance in the 1990s, have combined to make it a defining symbol of the 1980s for Australians. While the variety of helmet colours expanded throughout the years, the design did not.
