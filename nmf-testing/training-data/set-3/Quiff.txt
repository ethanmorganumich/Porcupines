Quiff
||||||
The quiff is a hairstyle that combines the 1950s pompadour hairstyle, the 1950s flattop, and sometimes a mohawk. It was born as a post-war reaction to the short and strict haircuts for men. The hairstyle was a staple in the British 'Teddy Boy' movement, but became popular again in Europe in the early 1980s and experienced a resurgence in popularity during the 1990s.
