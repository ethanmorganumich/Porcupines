Folkewall
||||||
The Folkewall is a construction with the dual functions of growing plants and purifying greywater. It was designed by Folke Günther in Sweden.Inspired by the "Sanitas wall" at Dr Gösta Nilsson's Sanitas farm project in Botswana, this technique makes an efficient use of space by fulfilling two essential functions: vertical plant growing and purification of greywater. This system is also known as a living wall or green wall.
