Leasing~Real property law~

NNN lease
||||||
For United States commercial real estate, normally the landlord, rather than the tenant, is responsible for real estate taxes, maintenance, and insurance. In a "net lease," in addition to base rent, the tenant or lessee is responsible for paying, some or all of the recoverable expenses related to real-estate ownership. As the rent collected under a net lease is "net" after expenses are passed through to tenants to be paid, the base rent tends to be lower than rent charged under a gross lease.
Net lease types include single net, double net, and triple net leases, depending on the number of items they include. The term "net lease" is often used as a shorthand expression for any of these arrangements. The three most common expenses charged back are property taxes, insurance, and maintenance, often called the "three nets". A triple net lease that includes the three nets is particularly common and is often abbreviated in writing as "NNN lease" but is still pronounced as "triple net lease".
