iDVD is a discontinued DVD authoring application for Mac OS produced by Apple Inc. iDVD allows the user to burn QuickTime movies, MP3 music, and digital photos to a DVD that can then be played on a commercial DVD player. It was often considered the last step of Apple's iLife suite, bringing together the results of all of the other iLife apps onto a removable medium.
