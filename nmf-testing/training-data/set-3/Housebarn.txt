A housebarn (also house-barn or house barn) is a building that is a combination of a house and a barn under the same roof. Most types of housebarn also have room for livestock quarters. If the living quarters are only combined whith a byre, whereas the cereals are stored outside the main building, the house is called a byre-dwelling.
