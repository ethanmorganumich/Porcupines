Gründerzeit (German pronunciation: [ˈɡʁʏndɐˌtsaɪt]; "founders' period") was the economic phase in 19th-century Germany and Austria before the great stock market crash of 1873. In Central Europe, the age of industrialisation had been taking place since the 1840s. That period is not precisely dated, but in Austria, the March Revolution of 1848 is generally accepted as the beginning of economic changes, in contrast to political reforms. In Germany, as a consequence of the large influx of capital resulting from French war reparations from the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871 and the subsequent unification of Germany, an economic boom then gave rise to the description of these years as the "entrepreneurs' years".
These years in Central Europe saw citizens increasingly influence cultural development. The time was also one of classical liberalism, even if the political demands of the time were only partially met. Industrialisation also posed aesthetic challenges, above all in the fields of architecture and craftsmanship, through development of existing forms.
In common language, the term Gründerzeitstil is often mingled with Historicism, which was the predominant architectural style after 1850 until 1914, which led to a blurring of the terms. In historical context, different decades are often also called Gründerzeit. For that reason, the term Gründerzeit is used to refer to several periods, such as 1850–1873, 1871–1890, sometimes 1850–1914 in reference to the architecture, or just 1871–1873.
