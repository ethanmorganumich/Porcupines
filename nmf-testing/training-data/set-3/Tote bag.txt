Tote bag
||||||
A tote bag is a large and often unfastened bag with parallel handles that emerge from the sides of its pouch.
Totes are often used as reusable shopping bags. The archetypal tote bag is made of sturdy cloth, perhaps with thick leather at its handles or bottom; leather versions often have a pebbled surface. Common fabrics include canvas, jute, nylon and other easy-care synthetics, which have become common, although these may degrade with prolonged exposure to sunlight. Many low-cost totes are often made from recycled matter, from minimally-processed natural fibers, or from byproducts of processes that refine organic materials.
