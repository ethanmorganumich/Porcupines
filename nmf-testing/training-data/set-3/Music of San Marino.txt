San Marino is a small sovereign state located within the territory of Italy. It has a musical heritage which includes the 17th-century composer Francesco Maria Marini di Pesaro and the 20th-century composer Cesare Franchini Tassini (1925â€“2010).
Since 1894, a wordless composition by Federico Consolo has been the national anthem of San Marino. The piece is based on a 10th-century choral composition. The previous anthem was by Aur. Muccioli and U. Balsimelli, and is similar to the Italian national anthem. mew
