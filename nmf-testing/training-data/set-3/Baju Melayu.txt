Baju Melayu
||||||
Baju Melayu (Jawi: باجو ملايو) is a traditional Malay costume, originated from the court of Malacca Sultanate and is traditionally worn by men in Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore, parts of Indonesia (especially Sumatra and Kalimantan), southern Philippines, and southern Thailand. It literally translates as Malay dress and consists of two main parts. The first being the baju (long-sleeved shirt) itself which has a raised stiff collar known as the cekak musang collar (literally fox's leash). The second part is the trousers called seluar. The two parts are made out of the same type of fabric which is usually cotton, or a mixture of polyester and cotton. A skirt-type adornment is also commonly worn with the Baju Melayu, which is either the kain samping, made out of songket, tenun cloth or the kain sarung, made out of cotton or a polyester mix. Both are loops of fabric that are folded around the wearer's waist. Jet-black or dark-colored headgear called the songkok can also worn to complete the attire.
