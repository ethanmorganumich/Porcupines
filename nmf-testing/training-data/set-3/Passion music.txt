Passion (music)
||||||
In Christian music, a Passion is a setting of the Passion of Christ. Liturgically, most Passions were intended to be performed as part of church services in the Holy Week.
Passion settings developed from Medieval intoned readings of the Gospel texts relating Christ's Passion, to which later polyphonic settings were added. Passion Plays, another tradition that originated in the Middle Ages, could be provided with music such as hymns, contributing to Passion as a genre in music.
While Passion music in Catholic countries had to compete with other devotions such as the Stations of the Cross, the Improperia and  Tenebrae, in Protestant Germany settings of the Gospels became a focal point of Passiontide services, with Passion cantatas (and later Passions in oratorio format) performed on Passion Sunday, Palm Sunday and Good Friday. Its best known examples, the Bach Passions, date from the first half of the 18th century.
Later musical settings of the Passion of Christ, such as the Jesus Christ Superstar Rock opera, or Arvo PÃ¤rt's Passio refer to these earlier Christian traditions to varying degrees.
