Philosophy of history
||||||
Philosophy of history is the philosophical study of history and its discipline. The term was coined by French philosopher Voltaire.In contemporary philosophy a distinction has developed between speculative philosophy of history and critical philosophy of history, now referred to as analytic. The former questions the meaning and purpose of the historical process whereas the latter studies the foundations and implications of history and the historical method. The names of these are derived from C. D. Broad's distinction between critical philosophy and speculative philosophy.
