Libertarian Party of Michigan
||||||
The Libertarian Party of Michigan is a Michigan state political party advocating a libertarian ideology and the state affiliate of the Libertarian Party of the United States. The party gained primary ballot access status in 2016 because of the vote total of presidential nominee Gary Johnson. The party lost their status since their 2018 gubernatorial nominee Bill Gelineau failed to reach that threshold in the general election.
Several Libertarians have held public office in Michigan, most at the local level. The party is a member of the Michigan Third Parties Coalition which advocates changes in Michigan's election laws.
