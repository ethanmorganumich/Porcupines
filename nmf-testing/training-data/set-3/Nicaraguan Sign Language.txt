Nicaraguan Sign Language

Nicaraguan Sign Language (ISN; Spanish: Idioma de Se√±as de Nicaragua) is a form of sign language which developed spontaneously among deaf children in a number of schools in Nicaragua in the 1980s. It is of particular interest to linguists as it offers them a unique opportunity to study what they believe to be the birth of a new language.
