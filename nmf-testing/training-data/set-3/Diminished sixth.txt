Diminished sixth
||||||
In classical music from Western culture, a diminished sixth (Play ) is an interval produced by narrowing a minor sixth by a chromatic semitone. For example, the interval from A to F is a minor sixth, eight semitones wide, and both the intervals from A♯ to F, and from A to F♭ are diminished sixths, spanning seven semitones. Being diminished, it is considered a dissonant interval, despite being equivalent to an interval known for its consonance.
Its inversion is the augmented third, and its enharmonic equivalent is the perfect fifth.
