Terminal ballistics

Terminal ballistics (also known as wound ballistics) is a sub-field of ballistics concerned with the behavior and effects of a projectile when it hits and transfers its energy to a target. 
Bullet design (as well as the velocity of impact) largely determine the effectiveness of penetration.
