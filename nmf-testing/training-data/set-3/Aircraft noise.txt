Aircraft noise pollution
||||||
Aircraft noise pollution refers to noise produced by aircraft in flight that has been associated with several negative stress-mediated health effects, from sleep disorders to cardiovascular ones. Governments have enacted extensive controls that apply to aircraft designers, manufacturers, and operators, resulting in improved procedures and cuts in pollution.
Sound production is divided into three categories:

Mechanical noise—rotation of the engine parts, most noticeable when fan blades reach supersonic speeds.
Aerodynamic noise—from the airflow around the surfaces of the aircraft, especially when flying low at high speeds.
Noise from aircraft systems—cockpit and cabin pressurization and conditioning systems, and Auxiliary Power units.
