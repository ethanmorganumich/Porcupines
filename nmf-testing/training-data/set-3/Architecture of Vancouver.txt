Architecture of Vancouver
||||||
The architecture of Vancouver and the Greater Vancouver area holds a combination of modern architectural styles, ranging from the 20th century Edwardian style to the 21st century modernist style and beyond. Initially, the city's architects embraced styles and ideas developed in Europe and the United States with only limited local variation.
In the years following World War II, regional variations of modernism began to emerge, known as "West Coast style" (particularly West Coast contemporary style). Building constraints in the area led to inventive designs to make construction feasible, as well as to take advantage of the scenery. This led to the development of designs that use complex geometric forms, open-plan layouts, and the desire for natural light, leading to the extensive use of glass. This use of glass has since proliferated into the designs of commercial buildings in Vancouver. Because the region's temperate climate and less-harsh sun makes having large walls of non-heat and sun-reflecting glass feasible, many high rises in Downtown Vancouver have favoured transparent glass aesthetics. The predominance of glass has led to the city moniker "City of Glass" and "See Through City".Architectural styles found throughout the American Pacific Coast – such as the American Craftsman, California bungalow, and dingbat – continue to be common residential styles in Vancouver. In addition to those residential styles, in the mid-20th century a residential style known as the Vancouver Special was developed in the city.
