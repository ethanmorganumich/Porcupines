Jengki style
||||||
Jengki, also known as Yankee style, was a post-war modernist architectural style developed in Indonesia following its independence. The style was popular between late 1950s and early 1960s.Jengki style reflected the new influence of the United States on Indonesian architecture after hundreds years of the Dutch colonial rule. It can be interpreted as a tropical interpretation of American post-war modernist suburb houses. Johan Silas, a native architect, speculates that this distinctive architecture is an expression of the political spirit of freedom among the Indonesians, which translated into an architecture that differs from what the Dutch had done.
