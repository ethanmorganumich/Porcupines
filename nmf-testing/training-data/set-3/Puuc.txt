Puuc

Puuc is the name of either a region in the Mexican state of Yucatán or a Maya architectural style prevalent in that region.  The word puuc is derived from the Maya term for "hill".  Since the Yucatán is relatively flat, this term was extended to encompass the large karstic range of hills in the southern portion of the state, hence, the terms Puuc region or Puuc hills.  The Puuc hills extend into northern Campeche and western Quintana Roo.
The term Puuc is also used to designate the architectural style of ancient Maya sites located within the Puuc hills, hence, the term Puuc architecture.  This architectural style began at the end of the Late Classic period but experienced its greatest extent during the Terminal Classic period.
