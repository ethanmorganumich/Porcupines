Knit cap
||||||
A knit cap is a piece of knitted headwear designed to provide warmth in cold weather. It usually has a simple tapered shape, although more elaborate variants exist. Historically made of wool, it is now often made of synthetic fibers.
Found all over the world where the climate demands warm clothing, knit caps are known by a variety of local names. In American English this type of hat is known as a beanie, while in Canadian English, a knit cap is known as a toque, touque, or tuque (pronounced ).
