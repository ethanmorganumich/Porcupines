The Algerian Scale is a scale frequently used in Algerian, Berber, and North African music. The frequent use of 1.5 steps (a minor 3rd) in the scale contributes to a sound commonly associated with Moorish music.

It is also defined as an eleven note scale with two augmented seconds. Jacques Ibert first used this definition in Escales (1924).In India's Carnatic music, this corresponds to Simhendramadhyamam.
