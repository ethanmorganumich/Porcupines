Hangaroc
||||||
A hangaroc was an apron-like outer garment worn by women of Norse origins in the 8th, 9th and 10th centuries.  In its usual form the hangaroc comprised a woollen or linen tailored tube wrapped around the body under the armpits and suspended by a pair of cloth straps that ran over the shoulders.  It hung down to mid-calf.Hangarocs were usually secured by a pair of oval brooches, called "tortoise brooches", which are diagnostic of women's graves from the period.  Wealthier women would wear their hangaroc decorated with braided wool or embroidery.
