Colour fastness
||||||
Colour fastness is a term—used in the dyeing of textile materials—that characterizes a material's colour's resistance to fading or running. Colour fastness is the property of dyes and it is directly proportional to the binding force between photochromic dye and the fiber. The colour fastness may also be affected by processing techniques and choice of chemicals and axillaries.The term is usually used in the context of clothes. In general, clothing should be tested for colour fastness before using bleach or other cleaning products.
Light fastness, wash fastness, and rub fastness are the main forms of colour fastness that are standardized. The light fastness of textile dye is categorized from one to eight and the wash fastness from one to five, with a higher the number indicating better fastness.
