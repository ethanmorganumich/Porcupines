Clapboard (), also called bevel siding, lap siding, and weatherboard, with regional variation in the definition of these terms, is wooden siding of a building in the form of horizontal boards, often overlapping.

Clapboard in modern American usage is a word for long, thin boards used to cover walls and (formerly) roofs of buildings. Historically, it has also been called clawboard and cloboard. In the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand, the term weatherboard is always used.An older meaning of "clapboard" is small split pieces of oak imported from Germany for use as barrel staves, and the name is a partial translation (from klappen, "to fit") of Middle Dutch klapholt and related to German Klappholz.
