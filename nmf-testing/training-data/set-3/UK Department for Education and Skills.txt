Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)
||||||
The Department for Education and Skills (DfES) was a United Kingdom government department between 2001 and 2007,  responsible for the education system (including higher education and adult learning) as well as children's services in England.
The department was led by Secretary of State for Education and Skills.
The DfES had offices at four main locations: London (both at the Sanctuary Buildings and Caxton House), Sheffield (Moorfoot),  Darlington (Mowden Hall), and Runcorn (Castle View House). The DfES was also represented in regional Government Offices.
The DfES had jurisdiction only in England as education was the responsibility of the Scottish Government, Welsh Assembly Government and the Northern Ireland Assembly.
On 28 June 2007, the DfES was split up into the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills. The DCSF was later reorganised as the Department for Education in 2010.
