Nigerian Pidgin, also called Naij√° or Naija, is an English-based creole language spoken as a lingua franca across Nigeria. The language is sometimes referred to as "Pijin" or Broken (pronounced "Brokun"). It can be spoken as a pidgin, a creole, slang or a decreolised acrolect by different speakers, who may switch between these forms depending on the social setting. In the 2010's, a common orthography was developed for Pidgin which has been gaining significant popularity in giving the language a harmonized writing system.Variations of what this article refers to as "Nigerian Pidgin" are also spoken across West and Central Africa, in countries such as Benin, Ghana, and Cameroon.As an example, the English phrase, "how are you?" would be "how you dey?" in Pidgin.
