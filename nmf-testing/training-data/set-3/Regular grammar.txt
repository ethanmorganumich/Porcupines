Regular grammar
||||||
In theoretical computer science and formal language theory, a regular grammar is a grammar that is right-regular or left-regular.
While their exact definition varies from textbook to textbook, they all require that

all production rules have at most one non-terminal symbol;
that symbol is either always at the end or always at the start of the rule's right-hand side.Every regular grammar describes a regular language.
