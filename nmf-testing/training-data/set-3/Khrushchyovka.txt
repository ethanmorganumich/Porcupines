Khrushchyovka (Russian: Хрущёвка, tr. Khrushchyovka, IPA: [xrʊˈɕːɵfkə]) or (a derogatory nickname) Khrushchoba (Russian: Хрущоба, tr. Hrushchoba, lit. 'Khru-slum') is an unofficial name for a type of low-cost, concrete-paneled or brick three- to five-storied apartment building which was developed in the Soviet Union during the early 1960s, during the time its namesake Nikita Khrushchev directed the Soviet government. They are sometimes compared to the Japanese danchi, similar (often government-sponsored) housing projects from the same period, which by some accounts were directly inspired by them. Preceding this type of housing, the majority of the Soviet housing stock was of low-rise communal apartments.
An updated high rise version, termed "Brezhnevkas", were built in the 1970s and 1980s and included many upgrades including larger apartments (particularly, larger kitchens), elevators, and garbage disposals. This was then followed by what are known unofficially as "Novostroikas," which in English means "new construction," and are still built in the panel house type structure used in the Soviet Union, but are taller, have 21st century amenities, parking, more colorful and decorative themes, and are built over a much larger space area. These however are not government-built, instead they are built by private contractors on behalf of local governments. An example of this is Kudrovo in Leningrad Oblast, Russia.
