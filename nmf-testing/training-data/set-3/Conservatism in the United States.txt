Conservatism in the United States is a political and social philosophy based on a belief in limited government, individualism, traditionalism, republicanism, and limited federal governmental power in relation to U.S. states. Conservative and Christian media organizations, along with American conservative figures, are influential, and American conservatism is one of the majority political ideologies within the Republican Party.American social conservatives typically support what they consider Christian values, moral absolutism, traditional family values, and American exceptionalism, while opposing abortion, euthanasia, and same-sex marriage. It favours economic individualism, and is generally pro-business and pro-capitalism, while supporting anti-communism and opposing labor unions. It often advocates a strong national defense, gun rights, free trade, and a defense of Western culture from perceived threats posed by both communism and moral relativism. Since the late 1990s, conservatives in the United States are substantially more likely than moderates and liberals to question science, specifically epidemiology, climate science, and evolution, and to believe in creationism.
