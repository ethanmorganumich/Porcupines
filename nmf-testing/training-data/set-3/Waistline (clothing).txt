Waistline (clothing)
||||||
The waistline is the line of demarcation between the upper and lower portions of a garment, which notionally corresponds to the natural waist but may vary with fashion from just below the bust to below the hips.  The waistline of a garment is often used to accentuate different features.  The waistline is also important as a boundary at which shaping darts (such as those over the bust and in the back) can be ended.
