Type 97 Service Dress were the military uniforms used by all branches of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) in both the People's Liberation Army Hong Kong Garrison and People's Liberation Army Macau Garrison beginning in 1997. These uniforms have since been replaced by the new Type 07 series of uniforms, which were unveiled in late June 2007 in conjunction with the 10th anniversary celebrations of the Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong.The uniform was selected to give a more formal and clean image for military personnel in Hong Kong.
