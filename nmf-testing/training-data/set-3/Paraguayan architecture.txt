Paraguayan architecture

The development of a distinct architectural style in Paraguay  is relatively recent.  This is due partially to the European influence following the colonization of the country in 1537. With the arrival of Europeans, and especially the Spanish, the architecture of the country developed with the construction of brick built cathedrals, palaces and many other European-style monuments.
