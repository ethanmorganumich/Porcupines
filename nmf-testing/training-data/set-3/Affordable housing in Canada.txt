Affordable housing in Canada
||||||
The continuum of affordable housing in Canada includes market (affordable rental housing and affordable home ownership), non-market (affordable rental housing and affordable home ownership), and government-subsidized housing (emergency shelters, transitional housing and social housing).
As of 2021, 68.55% of Canadian families owned their homes, up from 60% in 1999. About two thirds of households live in homes they own while the other third are in rental housing. As of 2018 Canada's housing marketplace provided housing for approximately 80% of Canadian households for both homeowners and renters.
Housing affordability is generally measured based on a shelter-cost-to-income ratio (STIR) of 30% by the national housing agency of Canada,  the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC). Changes to either the cost of housing or income affect affordability. Demographics and social geography inform affordability pressures on different groups of people. A large city in Canada with extremes of wealth and poverty, such as Calgary, Alberta can be the most affordable and least affordable municipality in Canada at the same time, when the question is "Affordable for whom?".
The definitions of affordability and affordable housing in Canada are varied depending on whether the term is used by banks and mortgage providers, real estate agencies in regards to market-based issues, consumers who may or may not be left out to the market, and advocacy organizations supporting the under-housed and unhoused populations.Starting in the 1980s, federal housing policies changed and more households across Canada began to experience housing affordability pressures, including those who own the residences in which they live and those who rent. In the 1980s, the concept of core housing need was developed by the CMHC as a basis for evaluating those eligible for federal funding under the 1986 Global Agreements on Social Housing, an agreement between the federal, provincial and territorial governments.  A household is considered to be in core housing need if it meets certain criteria—if it falls below acceptable standards of affordability, adequacy, or suitability and if the cost of housing exceeds 30% or more of its before-tax household income.
According to the historian Nathalie Rech in her entry on her 2019 entry "Homelessness in Canada" in the Canadian Encyclopedia, "homelessness" was not referred to as a social problem until the early to mid-1980s. By 2005, as the problem of homelessness increased, Canadian housing policy continued to focus only on "absolute homelessness" as there was no commonly accepted definition of homelessness. This changed in 2012 when the non-profit Canadian Observatory on Homelessness (COH) developed a definition based largely on the European Typology of Homelessness and Housing Exclusion (ETHOS) definition that was widely adopted across Canada. The accepted definition of homelessness in regards to programs and initiatives to respond to homelessness, now includes categories of people who were housed but were "at risk of homelessness" often because of experiencing housing affordability challenges. It also includes people who are "provisionally accommodated"—who may be living in over-crowded situations in shared housing with relatives or friends, or those who are in emergency shelters or transitional housing. The fourth category of homelessness includes the unsheltered—those who experience absolute homelessness.
Prior to November 2017, Canada was the only G8 nation that lacked a national housing strategy.  Canada's 2017 National Housing Strategy provided $40 billion of funding over 10 years to build 100,000 new affordable units, repair 300,000 affordable units and to cut homelessness by 50%.The 2020 report on the 2018 Survey revealed that 1,644,900 Canadian households or 11.6% were in core housing need, compared to 12.7% reported in the 2016 Canadian census. In 2016, the Canadian regions with the most households experiencing core housing need included Nunavut at 36.5%, Northwest Territories at 15.5%, Ontario at 15.3%, and Yukon at 15.2%. The 2016 Census also showed that the highest rates of core housing need in metropolitan areas were Toronto at 19.1% and Vancouver at 17.6%.By 2022, with an unexpected demand coupled with a diminishing supply of residential real estate along with historically low interest rates—set during the pandemic to stabilize the economy—the price of housing rose sky high in Canada. The BBC said that Canada faced some "of the worst housing affordability issues in the world". Based on the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) data, the "disconnect" between the average home price—$817,000—and household incomes is "one of the most dramatic". The price represents over "nine times household income". Experts anticipate the high prices and continued strong demand will result in renters dominating the market, particularly in large cities as many people will be priced out of the housing market.Concerns have been raised that Canada's "rental crisis"—a decrease in affordable rental units—has been exacerbated by the financialization of housing. The number of real estate investment trusts (REITs), hedge funds, private equity firms, and publicly listed real estate firms expanded exponentially over the last three decades in Canada, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Ireland. REITs are highly recommended as among the most reliable payers of dividends for their investors, particularly for pensioners and others who need safe investments. During the pandemic REITs thrived as they benefit from low mortgage rates and other CMHC grants and loans. While they do improve some apartments through conversions to condos or higher rental units, some housing experts say their business model includes eliminating affordable rental housing.
