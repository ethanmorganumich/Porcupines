King's Bench
||||||
The King's Bench (French: Cour du banc du Roi), or, during the reign of a female monarch, the Queen's Bench (Cour du banc de la Reine), is the superior court in a number of jurisdictions within some of the Commonwealth realms. The original King's Bench, founded in 1215 in England, was one of the ancient courts of the land and is now a division of the High Court of Justice of England and Wales. In the Commonwealth, the term King-on-the-Bench, or Queen-on-the-Bench is a title sometimes used to refer to the monarch in their ceremonial role within the justice system, as the fount of justice in that justice is carried out in their name.
