A fashion capital is a city with major influence on international fashion scene, from history, heritage, designers, trends, styles, to manufacturing innovation and retailing of fashion products, including events such as fashion weeks, fashion council awards, and trade fairs that together, generate significant economic output.With exquisite fashion heritage, structured organization, and the most vaunted fashion designers of the last century, four cities are considered the main fashion capitals of the 21st century. Called the "Big Four", the most prominent fashion capitals of the worldâ€”in chronological order of their eponymous fashion weeks, are New York, London, Milan, and Paris, which receive the majority of press coverage.
