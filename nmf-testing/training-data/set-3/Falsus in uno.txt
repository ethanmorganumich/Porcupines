Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus

Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus is a Latin maxim meaning "false in one thing, false in everything." At common law, it is the legal principle that a witness who testifies falsely about one matter is not credible to testify about any matter. Although many common law jurisdictions have rejected a categorical application of the rule, the doctrine has survived in some American courts.
