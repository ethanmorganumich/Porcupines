Encaenia
||||||
Encaenia (; en-SEE-nee-ə) is an academic or sometimes ecclesiastical ceremony, usually performed at colleges or universities. It generally occurs some time near the annual ceremony for the general conferral of degrees to students.  The word is from Latin, meaning dedication or consecration, and is ultimately derived from the Greek εγκαίνια (enkainia), meaning a festival of renewal or dedication, and corresponds to the English term commencement.
The term was originally used to indicate the eight days of celebration for the dedication of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem, which celebration covered also to the discovering of the True Cross by Empress Helena in 326. Because the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was consecrated on September 13, 335, the Encaenia started on September 13, while the cross itself was brought outside the church on September 14 so that the clergy and faithful could pray before the True Cross (Feast of the Cross).
