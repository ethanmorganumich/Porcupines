Fantasy Congress is an online game structured like fantasy sports where data gathered about congress is converted into points. Players create teams of individuals elected to the US House and Senate and members of congress acquire points based on legislative activity. Like fantasy sports, teams compete in small groups called leagues. At the end of the "season", each team with the most points in their league wins.
