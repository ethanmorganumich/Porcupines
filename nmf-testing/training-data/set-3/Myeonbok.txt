Myeonbok is a kind of ceremonial clothing worn by the kings of Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) in Korea. Myeonbok was adopted from Chinese Mianfu, and is worn by kings at special events such as the coronation, morning audience, lunar new year's audience, ancestral rites at Jongmyo and the soil and grain rite at Sajikdan. Myeonbok symbolizes the dignity of king when conducting important ceremonies.
