A manta is a rectangular textile that was worn as a blanket or as a wrap-around dress. When worn as a dress, the manta is held together by a woven sash.
Mantas are worn by such indigenous peoples as the Navajo, Hopi, and Pueblo peoples. Today they are worn during important ceremonies, such as weddings, dances, and feast days
