Architecture of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador
||||||
The architecture of St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador has a style distinct from that of the rest of Canada, and its major buildings are remnants of its history and prestige as the first British colonial capital.  The city of St. John's has had a long history, with inhabitation dating to the 16th century onwards.  As the city grew, so, too, did the landscape.  Buildings took a variety of styles according to the styles and means available to build the structures.  Starting as a fishing outpost for European fishermen, St. John's consisted mostly of the homes of fishermen, sheds, storage shacks, and wharves.  Of course, these structures were small and constructed out of wood.  Like many other cities of the time, as the Industrial Revolution took hold and new methods and materials for construction were introduced, the landscape changed as the city grew in width and height.  The Great Fire of 1892 destroyed most of the downtown core, and most residential and other wood-frame buildings date from this period.  Often compared to San Francisco because of its hilly terrain and steep maze of residential streets, housing in St. John's is typically painted in bright colours, unlike most other parts of Canada.
Due to St. John's being the oldest English settlement in North America to have grown into a city, many of its buildings have been designated by either the Minister of the Environment (upon the recommendations of the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada) or the Heritage Foundation of Newfoundland and Labrador as historic places.  
As of 2012, St. John's contains 21 National Historic Sites of Canada.
