Shed style

Shed Style refers to a style of architecture that makes use of single-sloped roofs (commonly called "shed roofs"). 
The style originated from the designs of architects Charles Willard Moore and Robert Venturi in the 1960s. Their works were influential to the style that would include the Sea Ranch in California (Moore)  and the Vanna Venturi House (Venturi).  Shed style architecture became very popular in the 1970s and 1980s, but most shed style homes stopped being built after the mid to late 1980s, though, today, houses use some characteristics from the shed style houses.
