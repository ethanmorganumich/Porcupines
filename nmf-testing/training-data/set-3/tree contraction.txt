Tree contraction

In computer science, parallel tree contraction is a broadly applicable technique for the parallel solution of a large number of tree problems, and is used as an algorithm design technique for the design of a large number of parallel graph algorithms.  Parallel tree contraction was introduced by Gary L. Miller and John H. Reif,  and has subsequently been modified to improve efficiency by X. He and Y. Yesha, Hillel Gazit, Gary L. Miller and Shang-Hua Teng and many others.Tree contraction has been used in designing many efficient parallel algorithms, including expression evaluation, finding lowest common ancestors, tree isomorphism, graph isomorphism, maximal subtree isomorphism, common subexpression elimination, computing the 3-connected components of a graph, and finding an explicit planar embedding of a planar graphBased on the research and work on parallel tree contraction, various algorithms have been proposed targeting to improve the efficiency or simplicity of this topic. This article hereby focuses on a particular solution, which is a variant of the algorithm by Miller and Reif, and its application.
