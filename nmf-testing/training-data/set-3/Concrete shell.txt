Concrete shell
||||||
A concrete shell, also commonly called thin shell concrete structure, is a structure composed of a relatively thin shell or shell of concrete, usually with no interior columns or exterior buttresses. The shells are most commonly monolithic domes, but may also take the form of hyperbolic paraboloids, ellipsoids, cylindrical sections, or some combination thereof. The first concrete shell dates back to the 2nd century.
