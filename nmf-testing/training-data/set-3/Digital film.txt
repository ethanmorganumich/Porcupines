Digital cinematography is the process of capturing (recording) a motion picture using digital image sensors rather than through film stock. As digital technology has improved in recent years, this practice has become dominant. Since the mid-2010s, most movies across the world are captured as well as distributed digitally.Many vendors have brought products to market, including traditional film camera vendors like Arri and Panavision, as well as new vendors like RED, Blackmagic, Silicon Imaging, Vision Research and companies which have traditionally focused on consumer and broadcast video equipment, like Sony, GoPro, and Panasonic.
As of 2017, professional 4K digital film cameras were approximately equal to 35mm film in their resolution and dynamic range capacity; however, digital film still has a different look from analog film. Some filmmakers still prefer to use analogue picture formats to achieve the desired results.
