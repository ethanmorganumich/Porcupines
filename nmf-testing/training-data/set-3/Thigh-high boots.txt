Thigh-high boots

Thigh-high boots, known also as thigh-length boots or simply thigh boots, are boots that extend above the knees to at least mid-thigh.  Other terms for this footwear include over-the-knee boots (abbreviated OTK boots; the full term is also used for the boots for women and especially when cuffed. Lengths vary from reaching just over the knee to reaching almost to the crotch (referred to as crotch boots or crotch-high boots).
Thigh boots are made of materials ranging from various leathers to various synthetic materials (including vinyl, polyurethane, or latex) to various fabrics (such as silk or polyester microfiber). Many are constructed with zippers, but some are designed as pull-on boots. Heel heights vary, but most styles are either flat or with heels greater than 3 inches (7.5 cm). Heel styles vary from metal spikes to chunky. Like other boots, they can also have platform soles.
Thigh boots are considered by many to be erotic or kinky. They are used as fetish clothing in boot fetishism and shoe fetishism. Cheaper thigh boots are often worn by prostitutes and professional female models, so many people consider them icons of such trades. Because of the latter, they are often associated with sadomasochism.  Nevertheless, they are frequently sold by couture designers, perhaps because of the implied eroticism. Thigh-high boots are considered by many a symbol of women's power, authority and sex appeal.
Thigh-high boots are wonderful on women with longer legs: "The shorter you are, the less leg there is above the top of the boot, when wearing footwear that ends above the knee. A very high heel helps to give the illusion of height, but when there is much more boot visible than leg; the effect is to optically foreshorten you."
