Nasserism

Nasserism (Arabic: التيار الناصري at-Tayyār an-Nāṣirī) is an Arab nationalist and Arab socialist political ideology based on the thinking of Gamal Abdel Nasser, one of the two principal leaders of the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, and Egypt's second President. Spanning the domestic and international spheres, it combines elements of Arab socialism, republicanism,  nationalism, anti-imperialism, developing world solidarity, Pan-Arabism, and international non-alignment.
Many other Arab countries have adopted Nasserist forms of government during the last century, most being formed during the 1960s, including Muammar Gaddafi's Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1977–1986) and later the Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya (1986–2011) after the 1986 United States bombing of Libya. The Nasserist ideology is also similar in theory to the Ba'athist ideology which was also notably practiced under Saddam Hussein's Ba'athist Iraq (1968–2003) and under Hafez al-Assad and now Bashar al-Assad's Syrian Arab Republic (1971–present).
