Gore (segment)
||||||
A gore is a sector of a curved surface  or the curved surface that lies between two close lines of longitude on a globe and may be flattened to a plane surface with little distortion.  The term has been extended to include similarly shaped pieces such as the panels of a hot-air balloon or parachute,  or the triangular insert that allows extra movement in a garment (see Gore (fabrics)).
