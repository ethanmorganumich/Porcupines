The Gandhi cap (Hindi: गांधी टोपी) is a white sidecap, pointed in front and back and having a wide band. It is made out of khadi. It takes its name after the Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, who created it and first popularised its use during the Indian independence movement. 
Worn commonly by Indian independence activists, it became a symbolic tradition for politicians and political activists to wear in independent India.
