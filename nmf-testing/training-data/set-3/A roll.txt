Footage
||||||
In filmmaking and video production, footage is raw, unedited material as originally filmed by a movie camera or recorded by a (often special) video camera, which typically must be edited to create a motion picture, video clip, television show or similar completed work.
Footage may also refer to sequences used in film and video editing, such as special effects and archive material (for special cases of this, see stock footage and B roll). 
Since the term originates in film, footage is only used for recorded images, such as film stock, videotapes or digitized clips â€“ on live television, the signals from video cameras are instead called sources.
