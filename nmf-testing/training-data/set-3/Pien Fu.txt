Bianfu (Chinese: 弁服; pinyin: biànfú) is a historical set of attire in Hanfu consisting of a knee-length Chinese upper garment known as jiangshapao (Chinese: 绛纱袍) over a qun, a Chinese skirt, known as hongchang (Chinese: 红裳; lit. 'red skirt') or pair of ku-trousersalong with other accessories. Coupled with the Chinese head wear known as pibian, the complete set of attire is also referred as pibianfu (Chinese: 皮弁服). This set of attire was considered to be a ceremonial dress. In the Zhou dynasty, the bianfu was only ranked-second after the mianfu and it was worn by the emperors when he would work on official business or when he would meet with the court officials.
