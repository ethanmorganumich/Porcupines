The architectural school of Nakhchivan (Azerbaijani: Naxçıvan memarlıq məktəbi) is one of architectural schools developed in medieval ages on the territory of modern Azerbaijan.  It was founded by Ajami Nakhchivani in the 12th century. The mausoleums of Yusif ibn Kuseyir (the first in 1162) and Momine Khatun (the second in 1186), constructed by him in Nakhchivan are a classical example of constructions of this school.
