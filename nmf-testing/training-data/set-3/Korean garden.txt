Korean gardens are a type of garden described as being natural, informal, simple and unforced, seeking to merge with the natural world. They have a history that goes back more than two thousand years, but are little known in the west. The oldest records date to the Three Kingdoms period (57 BC â€“ 668 AD) when architecture and palace gardens showed a development noted in the Korean History of the Three Kingdoms.
