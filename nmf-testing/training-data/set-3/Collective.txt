Collective
||||||
A collective is a group of entities that share or are motivated by at least one common issue or interest, or work together to achieve a common objective. Collectives can differ from cooperatives in that they are not necessarily focused upon an economic benefit or saving, but can be that as well.
The term "collective" is sometimes used to describe a species as a wholeâ€”for example, the human collective.
For political purposes, a collective is defined by decentralized, or "majority-rules" decision making styles.
