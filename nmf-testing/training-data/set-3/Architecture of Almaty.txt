Architecture of Almaty
||||||
The city of Almaty (Kazakhstan) has notable examples of architecture, particularly from the 19th century period.  These include characteristic designs in neo-Russian style from major architects including Andrei Pavlovich Zenkov, Paul Gourdet, and others. 
Almaty is referred to as “The garden city” on account of its green plantations. During the 19th century, a large number of theatres, museums and apartment houses were built. The city’s apartment houses are called “Khrushchyovka” and “Stalinka” due to the peculiarities of architectural approaches in their construction.
