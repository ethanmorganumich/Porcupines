Pseudo-octave
||||||
A pseudo-octave, pseudooctave, or paradoxical octave in music is an interval whose frequency ratio is not 2:1 (2.3:1 or 1.9:1, for example), that of the octave,  but is perceived or treated as equivalent to this ratio, and whose pitches are considered equivalent to each other as with octave equivalency.
