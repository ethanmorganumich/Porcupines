Catenary arch
||||||
A catenary arch is a type of architectural arch that follows an inverted catenary curve. The catenary curve has been employed in buildings since ancient times.  It forms an underlying principle to the overall system of vaults and buttresses in stone vaulted Gothic cathedrals  and in Renaissance domes. It is not a parabolic arch.
