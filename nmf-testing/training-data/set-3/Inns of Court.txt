Inns of Court

The Inns of Court in London are the professional associations for barristers in England and Wales. There are four Inns of Court â€“ Gray's Inn, Lincoln's Inn, Inner Temple and Middle Temple.All barristers must belong to one of them. They have supervisory and disciplinary functions over their members. The Inns also provide libraries, dining facilities and professional accommodation. Each also has a church or chapel attached to it and is a self-contained precinct where barristers traditionally train and practise, although growth in the legal profession, together with a desire to practise from more modern accommodations and buildings with lower rents, caused many barristers' chambers to move outside the precincts of the Inns of Court in the late 20th century.
