Irish lace

Irish lace has always been an important part of the Irish needlework tradition. Both needlepoint and bobbin laces were made in Ireland before the middle of the eighteenth century, but never, apparently, on a commercial scale. It was promoted by Irish aristocrats such as Lady Arabella Denny, the famous philanthropist, who used social and political connections to support the new industry and promote the sale of Irish lace abroad.  Lady Denny, working in connection with the Dublin Society, introduced lace-making into the Dublin workhouses, especially among the children there.  It is thought that it was an early form of Crochet, imitating the appearance of Venetian Gros Point lace.
