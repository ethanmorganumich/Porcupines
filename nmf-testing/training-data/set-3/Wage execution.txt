Garnishment
||||||
Garnishment is a legal process for collecting a monetary judgment on behalf of a plaintiff from a defendant. Garnishment allows the plaintiff (the "garnishor") to take the money or property of the debtor from the person or institution that holds that property (the "garnishee"). A similar legal mechanism called execution allows the seizure of money or property held directly by the debtor.
Some jurisdictions may allow for garnishment by a tax agency without the need to first obtain a judgment or other court order.
