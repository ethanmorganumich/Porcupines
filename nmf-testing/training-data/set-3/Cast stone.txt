Cast stone
||||||
Cast stone or reconstructed stone is a highly refined building material, a form of  precast concrete used as masonry intended to simulate natural-cut stone.  It is used for architectural features: trim, or ornament; facing buildings or other structures; statuary; and for garden ornaments. Cast stone can be made from white and/or grey cements, manufactured or natural sands, crushed stone or natural gravels, and colored with mineral coloring pigments. Cast stone may replace such common natural building stones as limestone, brownstone, sandstone, bluestone, granite, slate, coral, and travertine.
