Chapatsu
||||||
Chapatsu (茶髪/ちゃぱつ), literally "tea hair" in the Japanese language, is a style of bleaching (and occasionally dyeing) hair, found among Japanese teens. The style was once banned at Japanese schools and became a widespread topic of the civic right to self-expression, but discussion of the topic died down due to the ubiquity of the style.
