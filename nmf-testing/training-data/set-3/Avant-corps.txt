Avant-corps
||||||
An avant-corps (Italian: avancorpo or risalto, plural risalti, German: Risalit, Polish: ryzalit), a French term literally meaning "fore-body", is a part of a building, such as a porch or pavilion, that juts out from the corps de logis, often taller than other parts of the building. It is common in façades in French Baroque architecture.
Particularly in German architecture, a corner Risalit is where two wings meet at right-angles. Baroque three-winged constructions often incorporate a median Risalit in a main hall or a stairwell, such as in Weißenstein Palace and the Roßleben Convent School.
