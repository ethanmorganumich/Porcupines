Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice
||||||
Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice (SHARP) are anti-racist skinheads who oppose white power skinheads, neo-fascists and other political racists, particularly if they identify themselves as skinheads. SHARPs aim to reclaim the original multicultural identity of the original skinheads, hijacked by white power skinheads, who they sometimes deride as "boneheads".SHARP professes no political ideology or affiliation, beyond the common opposition to racism. The group stresses the importance of the black Jamaican influence in the original late-1960s skinhead movement much akin to Trojan Skinheads.
