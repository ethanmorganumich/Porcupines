The architecture of Sri Lanka displays a rich variety of architectural forms and styles. Shaivism has had a significant influence on early Sri Lankan architecture, during the reign of King Ravana, then Buddhism has also had a significant influence on Sri Lankan architecture, since it was introduced to the island in the 3rd century BCE.Traditionally, Indian and Chinese architecture have been the most significant forms of foreign influence on Sri Lankan architecture and both have played a prominent role in shaping it. Architectural influences from Southeast Asia have also influenced the development of Sri Lankan architecture and vice versa. Techniques and styles developed in Europe, transported to the country via colonialism, also played a major role in the architecture of Sri Lanka later on. Many buildings survive from the Dutch and British period of occupation.
