Vision span
||||||
Vision span or perceptual span is a controversial concept referring to the angular span (vertically and horizontally), within which  the human eye has sharp enough vision to perform an action accurately (reading or face recognition). The visual field of the human eye spans approximately 120 degrees of arc.  However, most of that arc is peripheral vision. The human eye has much greater resolution in the macula, where there is a higher density of cone cells.  The macula has a diameter of about 16 degrees of the retina.  The field of view that is observed with sufficient resolution to read text typically spans about 6 degrees of arc, which is wide enough to allow a clear view of about five words in a row when printed text at ordinary size is held about 50 centimeters from the eyes. Regarding face processing, the field of view with a sufficient amount of information in order to recognise faces accurately spans about 7Â° which represents about 45% of a face. The brain creates the illusion of having a greater visual span by automatically and unconsciously moving the center of vision into any area of interest in the field of view.
