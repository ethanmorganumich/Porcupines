Cambric

Cambric or batiste, is a fine dense cloth. It is a lightweight  plain-weave fabric, originally from the commune of Cambrai (in present-day northern France), woven greige (neither bleached nor dyed), then bleached, piece-dyed, and often glazed or calendered. Initially it was made of linen; from the 18th and 19th centuries the term came to apply to cotton fabrics as well. Chambray is the same type of fabric, with a coloured (often blue or grey)  warp and white filling; the name "chambray" replaced "cambric" in the  United States in the early 19th century.Cambric is used as fabric for linens, shirts, handkerchiefs, ruffs, lace, and in needlework.
