Maguindanao (locally [maˈɡindɐnaʊ, -ginˈdanaʊ], Maguindanaon: Prubinsya nu Magindanaw; Iranun: Perobinsia a Magindanao; Tagalog: Lalawigan ng Maguindanao) was a province of the Philippines located in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM). From 2014 to 2022, its provincial capital was Buluan, but the legislative branch of government, the Maguindanao Provincial Board, convened at the old provincial capitol in Sultan Kudarat. It bordered Lanao del Sur to the north, Cotabato to the east, Sultan Kudarat to the south, and the Illana Bay to the west. 
The province was replaced by Maguindanao del Sur and Maguindanao del Norte since September 18, 2022 after a division of the province was approved in a plebiscite.
