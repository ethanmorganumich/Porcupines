Triquetra
||||||
The triquetra (; from the Latin adjective triquetrus "three-cornered")
is a triangular figure composed of three interlaced arcs, or (equivalently) three overlapping  vesicae piscis lens shapes.
It is used as an ornamental design in architecture, and in medieval manuscript illumination (particularly in the Insular tradition). Its depiction as interlaced is common in Insular ornaments from about the 7th century. In this interpretation, the triquetra represents the topologically  simplest possible knot.
