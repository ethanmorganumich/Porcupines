Clothing terminology
||||||
Clothing terminology comprises the names of individual  garments and classes of garments, as well as the specialized vocabularies of
the trades that have designed, manufactured, marketed and sold clothing over hundreds of years.
Clothing terminology ranges from the arcane (watchet, a pale blue color name from the 16th century), and changes over time in response to fashion which in turn reflects social, artistic, and political trends.
