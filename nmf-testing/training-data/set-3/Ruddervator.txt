V-tail
||||||
The V-tail or Vee-tail (sometimes called a butterfly tail or Rudlicki's V-tail) of an aircraft is an unconventional arrangement of the tail control surfaces that replaces the traditional fin and horizontal surfaces with two surfaces set in a V-shaped configuration. It is not widely used in aircraft design. The aft edge of each twin surface is a hinged control surface called a  ruddervator, which combines the functions of both a rudder and elevator.
The V-tail was invented in 1930 by Polish engineer Jerzy Rudlicki and was tested for the first time on the Hanriot H-28 trainer aircraft, modified by a Polish aerospace manufacturer Plage and La≈õkiewicz in the summer of 1931.
