Complement (set theory)
||||||
In set theory, the complement of a set A, often denoted by A∁ (or A′), is the set of elements not in A.When all sets in the universe, i.e. all sets under consideration, are considered to be members of a given set U, the absolute complement of A is the set of elements in U that are not in A.
The relative complement of A with respect to a set B, also termed the set difference of B and A, written 
  
    
      
        B
        ∖
        A
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle B\setminus A,}
   is the set of elements in B that are not in A.
