Troentorp Clogs are wooden clogs handcrafted in Troentorp, Sweden, a small village approximately three kilometers from B책stad, Sk책ne in southern Sweden. Troentorp Clogs (formerly known as B책stad Clogs) have gained international recognition, especially during the 1970s when Swedish clogs became a widely popular footwear.  The clogs have been made by Troentorp Toffelfabrick (Troentorp Clog Factory) in the same location since 1907 and continue to be produced with the original wood and leather design.
