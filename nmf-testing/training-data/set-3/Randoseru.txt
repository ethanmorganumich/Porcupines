Randoseru
||||||
A randoseru (ランドセル) is a firm-sided backpack made of stitched firm leather or leather-like synthetic material, most commonly used in Japan by elementary schoolchildren. Traditionally it is given to a child upon beginning their first year of school, whereupon the child uses the same bag until grade 6. The most common explanation is that term is borrowed from the Dutch ransel or German Ranzen meaning "backpack".
