Hanfu Movement (simplified Chinese: 汉服运动; traditional Chinese: 漢服運動; pinyin: Hànfú yùndòng), also known as the Hanfu Revival Movement (汉服复兴运动; 漢服復興運動; Hànfú fùxīng yùndòng), is a cultural movement seeking to revitalize Han Chinese fashion that developed in China since 2003.It is a social movement which aims at popularizing hanfu and integrating traditional Chinese elements into the design of modern clothing, as a way to promote traditional Chinese culture. Participants and supporters of the Hanfu Movement call themselves tongpao (同袍); a term, which comes from the Shijing:
How shall it be said that you have no clothes? I will share my long robes with you. [豈曰無衣、與子同袍。]
The king is raising his forces; [王于興師、]
I will prepare my lance and spear, [脩我戈矛]

And will be your comrade. [與子同仇]
The term tongpao is literally translated as "wearing the same style of robe" and is also a pun of tongbao (同胞) meaning "fellow compatriots".
