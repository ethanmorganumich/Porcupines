Akbari architecture
||||||
Akbarâ€™s architecture refers to the style of Indo-Islamic architecture conceived during the reign of Mughal Emperor Akbar using elite Indic architectural vocabulary. His successors further added to this style, leading to the unique and individualistic style of Mughal architecture. Some examples of this style are Humayun's Tomb, which was the first of a long succession of garden-tombs (and a predecessor of the Taj Mahal), the Agra Fort, the Allahabad Fort, the Lahore Fort, the abandoned city of Fatehpur Sikri and Akbar's own tomb.Fusion of Indian and Islamic features as multiplicity attracted him not uniformity.
