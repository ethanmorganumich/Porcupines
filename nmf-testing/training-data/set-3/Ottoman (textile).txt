Ottoman (textile)
||||||
Ottoman is a widthways-ribbed textile with pronounced, raised 'ribs' along its weft. Similar to grosgrain, Ottoman is known as a corded fabric, using a thicker yarn in the weft rather than the warp to create raised stripes running across the width of the fabric.
Ottoman may be knitted or woven, and produces a stiff, heavyweight fabric; knitted Ottoman features a likewise widthways rib structure. In knitting, the Ottoman rib pattern is knitted with double jersey machines. The rib lines in an Ottoman knit may vary in size from thin to coarse by adjusting yarn count and gauge.
