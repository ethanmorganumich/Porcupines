The Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing (ISTD) is an international dance teaching and examination board based in London, England. The registered educational charity, which was established on 25 July 1904 as the Imperial Society of Dance Teachers, provides training and examinations in a range of dance styles and certified dance teacher courses. The ISTD is recognised by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority and the Council for Dance Education and Training and is also a member of the British Dance Council. It hosts various competitions in many different formats including Modern Ballroom, Latin American, Classical Ballet and Tap Dance as well as contemporary styles like Disco Freestyle.
The ISTD is organised into two main faculty boards. Dancesport coordinates dance techniques that are normally performed in a ballroom or dance hall. Theatre is concerned with stage and film performance. The Cecchetti Society is also part of the ISTD. It exists to preserve the Cecchetti method of classical ballet training.  The ISTD is also represented on the committees of numerous other arts, dance and culture related organisations.
