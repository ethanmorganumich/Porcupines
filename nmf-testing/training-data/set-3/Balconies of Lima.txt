Most of these balconies are of the Viceroyalty period, built in the late 17th and 18th centuries, are located in the Historic Center of Lima. They were adapted for residential purposes and have influenced the lives of many Peruvian scholars such as the 19th century writer Ricardo Palma.
The balconies have been crucial in UNESCO's declaration of the Historic Center of Lima as a World Heritage Site.
