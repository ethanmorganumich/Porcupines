Mode volume
||||||
In fiber optics, mode volume is the number of bound modes that an optical fiber is capable of supporting.  
The mode volume M is approximately given by 
  
    
      
        
          
            V
            
              2
            
          
        
        2
      
    
    {\displaystyle V^{2} \over 2}
   and 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              V
              
                2
              
            
            2
          
        
        
          (
          
            
              g
              
                g
                +
                2
              
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {V^{2} \over 2}\left({g \over g+2}\right)}
  , respectively for step-index and power-law index profile fibers, where g is the profile parameter, and V is the normalized frequency, which must be greater than 5 for this approximation to be valid.
