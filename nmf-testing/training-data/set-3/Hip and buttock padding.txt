Hip and buttock padding
||||||
Hip and buttock padding is used to increase the apparent size of the hips and buttocks in order to increase apparent waist-hip ratio which implies more feminine body shape. It is used by both sexes: women wishing to increase their physical attractiveness, some transgender people including transsexuals and cross-dressers, and performers both male in drag and female. This technique is often used by drag queens to create the illusion of a feminine figure, often taking it to the extreme for comedic value.
