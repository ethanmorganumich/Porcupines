Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election
||||||
Opinion polling for the next United Kingdom general election has been carried out by various organisations to gauge voting intention. Most of the polling companies listed are members of the British Polling Council (BPC) and abide by its disclosure rules. The dates for these opinion polls range from the 2019 United Kingdom general election on 12 December to the present day.
Under the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, the next United Kingdom general election must be held no later than January 2025. The Act ensures that, if it has not already been dissolved at the request of the prime minister, Parliament automatically dissolves five years after it first met (17 December 2024) and polling day occurs no more than 25 working days later taking into account Christmas Eve and bank holidays in any part of the United Kingdom.
