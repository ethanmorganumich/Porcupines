A minuet (; also spelled menuet) is a social dance of French origin for two people, usually in 34 time. The English word was adapted from the Italian minuetto and the French menuet. 
The term also describes the musical form that accompanies the dance, which subsequently developed more fully, often with a longer musical form called the minuet and trio, and was much used as a movement in the early classical symphony.
