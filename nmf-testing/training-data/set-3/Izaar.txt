An izaar, also izar or ʾizār (Arabic: إِزَار), also known as futah (فُوطَة), (مَعَوَز), wizarah (وِزَرَة),  maqtab (مَقْطَب) is a clothing worn as a lower garment typically worn by men in Yemen, UAE, Iraq, Kuwait, Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, and the Horn of Africa (Somalia, Djibouti, Ethiopia and Eritrea). Omani people typically wear a white izaar underneath the Thawb instead of sirwar pyjamas. Izaar-like clothing is also worn in countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, Bangladesh, Pakistan and countries in some parts of East Africa and in India. It is commonly worn by Yemenis at home, and work. In some parts of Arabia such as Yemen and the Jizan and ʿAsir regions of Saudi Arabia, it is known as futah instead. It is also worn in the city of Aqaba. Some of these may feature tassels.
