A consumption wall is a very wide wall, which appears as a double-sided structure in-filled with smaller stones. 
An example can be seen in the Duddon Valley, Cumbria at Low Hall. Another example can be found near Harlech, Gwynedd, Wales which measures about six feet wide, indicating that they are spread throughout British agricultural regions.
