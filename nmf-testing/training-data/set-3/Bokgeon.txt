Fujin (Chinese: 幅巾; lit. 'Width of cloth') is a type of guanmao (冠帽), a male traditional headgear generally made from a black fabric in China and Korea. The fujin is a form of hood made on one width of cloth, from which its Chinese name derived from. It was usually worn with Shenyi in the Ming Dynasty. The fujin was later adopted in Joseon where is became known as bokgeon (Korean: 복건; Hanja: 幅巾) and became known as the 'hat of the Confucian scholars'. The fujin also influenced the development of other headwear such as the futou.
