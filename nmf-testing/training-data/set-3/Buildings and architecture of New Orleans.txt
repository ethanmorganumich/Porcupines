Buildings and architecture of New Orleans

The buildings and architecture of New Orleans are reflective of its history and multicultural heritage, from Creole cottages to historic mansions on St. Charles Avenue, from the balconies of the French Quarter to an Egyptian Revival U.S. Customs building and a rare example of a Moorish revival church.
The city has fine examples of almost every architectural style, from the baroque Cabildo to modernist skyscrapers.
