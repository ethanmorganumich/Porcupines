Velvet
||||||
Velvet is a type of woven tufted fabric in which the cut threads are evenly distributed, with a short  pile, giving it a distinctive soft feel. By extension, the word velvety means "smooth like velvet". In the past, velvet was typically made from silk. Today, velvet can be made from linen, cotton, wool and synthetic fibers.
