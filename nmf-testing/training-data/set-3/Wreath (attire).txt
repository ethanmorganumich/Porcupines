Wreath (attire)
||||||
A wreath worn for purpose of attire (in English, a "chaplet"; Ancient Greek: στέφανος, romanized: stéfanos, Latin: corona), is a headdress made of leaves, grasses, flowers or branches.  It is typically worn in festive occasions and on holy days and has a long history and association with ancient pageants and ceremonies. Outside occasional use, the wreath can also be used as a crown, or a mark of honour. The wreath most often has an annular geometric construction.
