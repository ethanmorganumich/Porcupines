Self-organising heuristic

In computing, a Self-organising heuristic is an algorithm that modifies a data structure such as a linked list in response to use of the data structure.
Examples might be:

Move-to-front (or 'Move to top')
Self-learning Frequency list (or 'Order by access frequency')
Re-insert at random position
Move to back
