Musical literacy

Musical literacy is the reading, writing, and playing of music, as well an understanding of cultural practice and historical and social contexts.
Music literacy and music education are frequently talked about relationally and causatively, however they are not interchangeable terms as complete musical literacy also concerns an understanding of the diverse practices involved in teaching music pedagogy and its impact on literacy. Even then, there are those who argue against the relational and causal link between music education and literacy, instead advocating for the solely interactional relationship between social characteristics and music styles. “Musical communications, like verbal ones, must be put in the right contexts by receivers if their meanings are to come through unobscured” which is why the pedagogical influence of teaching an individual to become musically-literate might be confused with overarching ‘literacy’ itself.
‘Musical literacy’ is likewise not to be confused with ‘music theory’ or ‘musicology’. These two components are aspects of music education that ultimately act as a means to an end of achieving such literacy. Even then, many scholars debate the relevancy of these educational elements to musical literacy at all. The term, ‘musicality’, is again a distinct term that is separate from the concept of ‘musical literacy’, as the way in which a musician expresses emotions through performance is not indicative of their music-reading ability.Given that musical literacy involves mechanical and descriptive processes (such as reading, writing and playing) as well as a broader cultural understanding of both historical and contemporary practice (i.e. listening, playing, and musical interpretation while listening and/or playing), education in these visual, reading/writing, auditory, and kinesthetic areas can work in tandem to achieve literacy as a whole.
