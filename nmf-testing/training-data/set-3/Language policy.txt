Language policy

Language policy is an interdisciplinary academic field. Some scholars such as Joshua Fishman and Ofelia Garc√≠a consider it as part of sociolinguistics. On the other hand, other scholars such as Bernard Spolsky, Robert B. Kaplan and Joseph Lo Bianco argue that language policy is a branch of applied linguistics.
As a field, language policy used to be known as language planning and is related to other fields such as language ideology, language revitalization, language education, among others.
