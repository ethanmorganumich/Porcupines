Ancient Celtic music
||||||
Deductions about the music of the ancient Celts of the La TÃ¨ne period (and their Gallo-Roman and Romano-British descendants of Late Antiquity)  rely primarily on Greek and Roman sources, as well as on archaeological finds and interpretations including the reconstruction of the Celts' ancient instruments. Most of the textual information centers on military conflicts and on maybe the most prominent Celtic instrument of its time, the carnyx.
