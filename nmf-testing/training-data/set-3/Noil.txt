Noil
||||||
Noil refers to the short fibers that are removed during the combing process in spinning. These fibers are often then used for other purposes. 
Fibers are chosen for their length and evenness in specific spinning techniques, such as worsted. The short noil fibers are left over from combing of wool or spinning silk.Noil may be treated as a shorter-staple fiber and spun, hand-plied, or used as wadding. Noil may also be used as a decorative additive in spinning projects like rovings and yarns. As noil is a relatively short fiber, fabric made from noil is weaker and often considered less valuable than that made using long lengths of longer staple lengths, though it is sometimes valued for aesthetic effects (see Slub (textiles)).
