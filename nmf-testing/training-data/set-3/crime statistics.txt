Crime statistics
||||||
Crime statistics refer to systematic, quantitative results about crime, as opposed to crime news or anecdotes. Notably, crime statistics can be the result of two rather different processes:

scientific research, such as criminological studies, victimisation surveys;
official figures, such as published by the police, prosecution, courts, and prisons.However, in their research, criminologists often draw on official figures as well.
