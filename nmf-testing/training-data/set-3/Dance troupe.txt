||||||
A dance troupe or dance company is a group of dancers and associated personnel who work together to perform dances as a sport, spectacle or entertainment. There are many different types of dance companies, often working in different styles of dance. Some companies are formed from members of dance studios or from paid professionals. Dance company members can range from as young as two years old up to 18 years old. Dance troupes may be formed for competition purposes. Many dance companies are established within cities to be near theatres or other performing art venues. A dance troupe will likely have performance costumes, sets or props, and proper footwear. A dance studio will more than likely be the location where dance classes and or practices will take place.
