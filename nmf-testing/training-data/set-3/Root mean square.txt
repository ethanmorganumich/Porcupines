In mathematics and its applications, the root mean square of a set of numbers

            i
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{i}}
   (abbreviated as RMS, RMS or rms and denoted in formulas as either 
  
    
      
        
          x
          
            
              R
              M
              S
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle x_{\mathrm {RMS} }}
   or 
  
    
      
        
          
            R
            M
            S
          
          
            x
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \mathrm {RMS} _{x}}
  ) is defined as the square root of the mean square (the arithmetic mean of the squares) of the set.
The RMS is also known as the quadratic mean (denoted 
  
    
      
        
          M
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle M_{2}}
  ) and is a particular case of the generalized mean. The RMS of a continuously varying function (denoted 
  
    
      
        
          f

    {\displaystyle f_{\mathrm {RMS} }}
  ) can be defined in terms of an integral of the squares of the instantaneous values during a cycle.
For alternating electric current, RMS is equal to the value of the constant direct current that would produce the same power dissipation in a resistive load.
In estimation theory, the root-mean-square deviation of an estimator is a measure of the imperfection of the fit of the estimator to the data.
