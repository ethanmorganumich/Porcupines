Vote pairing

Vote pairing, in the UK and Australia, or pairing, is the mechanism by which two members of parliament of opposing parties agree, with the consent of their party whips, to abstain from voting if the other one is unable to vote. Thus they maintain the balance of votes if one or the other is unable to attend. A three-line whip would usually be excepted from this agreement. For MPs who are not paired a bisque, a rota system allowing absence is used. This article is not about this process, but about peer to peer voting in elections among constituents.
In the US, pairing occurs when two legislators in the same chamber agree to allow their votes to cancel each other out. Such pairing can occur between members of the same party. For example, in 2018, Senators Murkowski and Daines (both Republican) paired their votes on the Kavanaugh nomination, so that the former voted "present", while the latter attended his daughter's wedding.Prior to the 2000 election, "vote pairing" also mean legislators in opposing parties agreeing. However, in that election, that term was overloaded to mean voting a third-party candidate instead of for their own candidates. For example, a disaffected Democrat and a disaffected Republican both agreeing to vote for a third-party candidate instead of for the candidates of their own parties. However, by the 2004 presidential election this "vote swapping" was also being called "vote pairing", and the various people who had created vote swapping sites for the 2000 election had banded together as the now-defunct website, VotePair.org. This has however since been overcome by the "swap" terminology used in Canada and the UK. Today, 'swap' is almost universally used to mean constituents, whereas 'pairing' continues to mean legislators agreeing to pair up.
Vote swapping or co-voting occurs when two people promise to voting in a mutually agreed upon manner. Vote pairing (like legislators, one on one) is the most common example of vote pairing, where a voter in one district agrees to vote tactically for a less-preferred candidate or party who has a greater chance of winning in their district, in exchange for a voter from another district voting tactically for the candidate the first voter prefers, because that candidate has a greater possibility of winning in that district.
Vote pairing occurs informally (i.e., without binding contracts) but sometimes with great sophistication in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. Organized online venues in all three countries have enabled persons who want to pair up to co-vote/swap. In all three countries, the process has been subjected to legal challenge and been deemed legal. see below'.
Using UK elections as an example, tactical voting is often between the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats. There may be one constituency in which the Labour Party and the Conservative Party candidates are running in a tight race, with the Liberal Democrat far behind. In another constituency, the Liberal Democrat and Conservative candidates may be in a tight race, with the Labour candidate far behind. A Liberal Democrat voter in the first constituency would agree to vote for the Labour candidate in exchange for a Labour voter from the second constituency voting for the Liberal Democrat candidate.
Tactical voting has been used since 2000 as a strategy for the U.S. presidential election, with voters from "safe" states, or nonswing states, voting for third-party candidates, and voters from states with contested races, or swing state, voting for the second-preference candidate of the voters from the third party. By the United States Electoral College for presidential elections, all of a state's votes go to the winning candidate for that state, no matter how close the margin was (Maine and Nebraska excepted). Often third-party candidates for president are unable to garner any Electoral College votes, but they can call attention to their causes by the total popular vote that they garner. In vote-pairing agreements, third-party supporters in swing states vote strategically with major-party supporters in nonswing states, in the hope that the third-party candidate will get more of the popular vote, while the major-party candidate gets more of the Electoral College vote.
