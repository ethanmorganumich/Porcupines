A ghungroo (Hindi: घुँघरू, Urdu: گھنگرو), also known as ghunghroo or ghunghru or ghungur or ghungura (Assamese, Bengali and Odia) or Chilanka or Salangai or Gejje (in Malayalam, Tamil and Kannada respectively), is one of many small metallic bells strung together to form ghungroos, a musical anklet tied to the feet of classical Indian dancers. The sounds produced by ghungroos vary greatly in pitch depending on their metallic composition and size. Ghungroos serve to accentuate the rhythmic aspects of the dance and allow complex footwork to be heard by the audience. They are worn immediately above the ankle, resting on the lateral malleolus and medial malleolus. A string of ghungroos can range from 50 to greater than 200 bells knotted together. Novice children dancers may start with 50 and slowly add more as they grow older and advance in their technical ability. Ghungroos are worn in traditional performances of classical Indian dance forms such as Bharatnatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi, Mohiniyattam, Lavani, and Odissi.
