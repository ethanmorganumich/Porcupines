Fireball is a search engine operated by Fireball Labs GmbH, based in Munich, Germany. Founded in 1996, Fireball was once the leading search engine in Germany, but quickly declined after being taken over by Lycos Europe and the rise of Google. In 2016, Fireball was re-established as an independent company and relaunched.
