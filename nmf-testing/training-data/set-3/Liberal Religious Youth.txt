Liberal Religious Youth
||||||
Liberal Religious Youth (LRY) was an autonomous, North American youth organization affiliated with the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA).  LRY was unique as a church youth group in that it was governed solely by its members, who were generally between the ages of fourteen and nineteen years old, with adults serving only in an advisory capacity.  Though partial funding and office space were provided by the UUA, primary funding was through an independent endowment, the investment of which was controlled by the LRY board of directors.Continental LRY was run by an executive committee, usually consisting of four or five full-time officers, elected to one-year positions by the board of directors.  Executive committee members shared an apartment and office in Boston and, like the board of directors, were all under the age of twenty. Throughout the 1960s and most of the 1970s, the LRY office was in the UU headquarters at 25 Beacon Street, Boston. In the late 1970s it was moved by the UUA to the basement of a smaller building behind the headquarters. The LRY Executive Committee wrote program materials for youth groups and kept in touch with their international membership via their newspaper, People Soup, which was also completely written, edited and published by the youth staff.
