Augmented tuning
||||||
An augmented tuning is  a musical tuning system for musical instruments that is associated with augmented triads, that is a root note, a major third, and an augmented fifth. The augmented fifth is constructed by stacking the major third with another major third. Consequently, all of the intervals are major thirds.
Augmented tunings are used for stringed instruments, especially guitars, and for wind instruments. For guitars, augmented tunings are called major thirds tunings.
