Their population is about 7700. Theirs is a hunter-gatherer culture for the most part, although they also practice slash and burn agriculture. The main crop grown is cassava, and their main source of protein is the paca, a large 6–12 kg (13–26 lb) rodent.  During the dry season, the Machiguenga also use fishing to supplement the protein in their diet.
