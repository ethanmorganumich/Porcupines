Trust instrument
||||||
A trust instrument (also sometimes called a deed of trust, where executed by way of deed) is an instrument in writing executed by a settlor used to constitute a trust.  Trust instruments are generally only used in relation to an inter vivos trust; testamentary trusts are usually created under a will.
