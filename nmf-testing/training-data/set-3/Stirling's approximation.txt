Stirling's approximation

In mathematics, Stirling's approximation (or Stirling's formula) is an approximation for factorials. It is a good approximation, leading to accurate results even for small values of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  . It is named after James Stirling, though a related but less precise result was first stated by Abraham de Moivre.The version of the formula typically used in applications is

(in Big Theta notation, as 
  
    
      
        n
        →
        ∞
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\to \infty }
  ), or, by changing the base of the logarithm (for instance in the worst-case lower bound for comparison sorting),
 Specifying the constant in the

        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Theta (\ln n)}
   error term gives 1/2ln(2πn), yielding the more precise formula

where the sign ~ means that the two quantities are asymptotic, that is, that their ratio tends to 1 as 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   tends to infinity. The following version of the bound holds for all 
  
    
      
        n
        ≥
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle n\geq 1}
  , rather than only asymptotically:

In particular, for 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   sufficiently large, it holds that
