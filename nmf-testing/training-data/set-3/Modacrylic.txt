Modacrylic
||||||
A modacrylic is a  synthetic copolymer. Modacrylics are soft, strong, resilient and dimensionally stable. They can be easily dyed, show good press and shape retention, and are quick to dry. They have outstanding resistance to chemicals and solvents, are not attacked by moths or mildew, and are nonallergenic. Among their uses are in apparel linings, furlike outerwear, paint-roller covers, scatter rugs, carpets, and work clothing and as hair in wigs.Commercial production of modacrylic fiber began in 1949 by Union Carbide Corporation in the United States. Modacrylic and acrylic fibers are similar in composition and at one time were in the same category. In 1960 the Federal Trade Commission decided to separate the two fibers and establish a category for each.The Federal Trade Commission defines modacrylic fibers as manufactured fibers in which the fiber-forming substance is any long-chain synthetic polymer composed of less than 85%, but at least 35% weight acrylonitrile units except when the polymer qualifies as rubber.
