Dense graph
||||||
In mathematics, a dense graph is a graph in which the number of edges is close to the maximal number of edges (where every pair of vertices is connected by one edge). The opposite, a graph with only a few edges, is a sparse graph. The distinction of what constitutes a dense or sparse graph is ill-defined, and depends on context.
The graph density of simple graphs is defined to be the ratio of the number of edges |E| with respect to the maximum possible edges.
For undirected simple graphs, the graph density is:

  
    
      
        D
        =
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              E
              
                |
              
            
            
              
                (
              
              
                
                  
                    |
                  
                  V
                  
                    |
                  
                
                2
              
              
                )
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              2
              
                |
              
              E
              
                |
              
            
            
              
                |
              
              V
              
                |
              
              (
              
                |
              
              V
              
                |
              
              −
              1
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D={\frac {|E|}{\binom {|V|}{2}}}={\frac {2|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}}}
  For directed, simple graphs, the maximum possible edges is twice that of undirected graphs (as there are two directions to an edge) so the density is:

  
    
      
        D
        =
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              E
              
                |
              
            
            
              2
              
                
                  
                    (
                  
                  
                    
                      
                        |
                      
                      V
                      
                        |
                      
                    
                    2
                  
                  
                    )
                  
                
              
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              E
              
                |
              
            
            
              
                |
              
              V
              
                |
              
              (
              
                |
              
              V
              
                |
              
              −
              1
              )
            
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle D={\frac {|E|}{2{\binom {|V|}{2}}}}={\frac {|E|}{|V|(|V|-1)}}}
  where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices in the graph. The maximum number of edges for an undirected graph is 
  
    
      
        
          
            
              (
            
            
              
                
                  |
                
                V
                
                  |
                
              
              2
            
            
              )
            
          
        
        =
        
          
            
              
                |
              
              V
              
                |
              
              (
              
                |
              
              V
              
                |
              
              −
              1
              )
            
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\binom {|V|}{2}}={\frac {|V|(|V|-1)}{2}}}
  , so the maximal density is 1 (for complete graphs) and the minimal density is 0 (Coleman & Moré 1983).
