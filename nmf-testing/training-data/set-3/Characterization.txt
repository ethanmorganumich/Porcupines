Characterization
||||||
Characterization or characterisation is the representation of persons (or other beings or creatures) in narrative and dramatic works.  The term character development is sometimes used as a synonym. This representation may include direct methods like the attribution of qualities in description or commentary, and indirect (or "dramatic") methods inviting readers to infer qualities from characters' actions, dialogue, or appearance.  Such a personage is called a character.  Character is a literary element.
