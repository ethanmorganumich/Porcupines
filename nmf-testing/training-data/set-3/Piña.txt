Piña
||||||
Piña (Tagalog pronunciation: [pɪˈnja] pi-NYAH) is a traditional Philippine fiber made from the leaves of the pineapple plant. Pineapples are indigenous to South America but have been widely cultivated in the Philippines since the 17th century, and used for weaving lustrous lace-like luxury textiles known as nipis fabric. The name is derived from Spanish piña, meaning "pineapple". 
In February 2018, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts, along with the government of Aklan, began the process of nominating Kalibo piña weaving in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.
