CYK algorithm
||||||
In computer science, the Cocke–Younger–Kasami algorithm (alternatively called CYK, or CKY) is a parsing algorithm for context-free grammars published by Itiroo Sakai in 1961. The algorithm is named after some of its rediscoverers: John Cocke, Daniel Younger, Tadao Kasami, and Jacob T. Schwartz. It employs  bottom-up parsing and dynamic programming.
The standard version of CYK operates only on context-free grammars given in Chomsky normal form (CNF). However any context-free grammar may be transformed (after convention) to a CNF grammar expressing the same language (Sipser 1997).
The importance of the CYK algorithm stems from its high efficiency in certain situations. Using big O notation, the worst case running time of CYK is 
  
    
      
        
          
            O
          
        
        
          (
          
            
              n
              
                3
              
            
            ⋅
            
              |
              G
              |
            
          
          )
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {O}}\left(n^{3}\cdot \left|G\right|\right)}
  , where 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
   is the length of the parsed string and 
  
    
      
        
          |
          G
          |
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \left|G\right|}
   is the size of the CNF grammar 
  
    
      
        G
      
    
    {\displaystyle G}
   (Hopcroft & Ullman 1979, p. 140). This makes it one of the most efficient parsing algorithms in terms of worst-case asymptotic complexity, although other algorithms exist with better average running time in many practical scenarios.
