Bavarian (German: Bairisch [ˈbaɪrɪʃ] (listen), Bavarian: Boarisch) or alternately Austro-Bavarian, is a West Germanic language, part of the Upper German family, together with Alemannic and East Franconian.
Bavarian is spoken by approximately 12 million people in an area of around 125,000 square kilometres (48,000 sq mi), making it the largest of all German dialects. It can be found in the German state of Bavaria (especially Old Bavaria), most of the Republic of Austria (excluding Vorarlberg) and the Italian region of South Tyrol. In 2008, 45 percent of Bavarians claimed to use only dialect in everyday communication. Prior to 1945, Bavarian was also prevalent in parts of the southern Czech Republic and western Hungary.The difference between Bavarian and Standard High German is larger than the difference between Danish and Norwegian or between Czech and Slovak; as such, there is disagreement regarding its classification. The International Organization for Standardization classifies it as a separate language, assigning it a unique ISO 639-3 language code (bar). It has been listed by UNESCO in the Atlas of Endangered Languages since 2009.
