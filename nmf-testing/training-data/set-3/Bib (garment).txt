Bib (garment)
||||||
A bib is a garment worn hanging from the neck on the chest to protect clothing from accidentally spilled food. Bibs are frequently used by young children, especially infants, but also by some adults. Bibs are also worn when consuming certain "messy" foods. In addition, bibs are used for infants when they drool a lot, for example when they are teething. In addition some adults wear a bib when they are eating some messy foods, like tomato spagheti or lobster. 
A bib may also refer to the part of a garment that covers the chest, a garment that used by a team to identify themselves on the field of play, a lead covering used to prevent X-ray radiation from reaching parts of the body not being X-rayed.
