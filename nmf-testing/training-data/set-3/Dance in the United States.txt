Dance in the United States
||||||
There is great variety in dance in the United States of America. It is the home of the hip hop dance, salsa, swing, tap dance and its derivative Rock and Roll, and modern square dance (associated with the United States of America due to its historic development in that countryâ€”twenty three U.S. states have designated it as their official state dance or official folk dance) and one of the major centers for modern dance. There is a variety of social dance and concert or performance dance forms with also a range of traditions of Native American dances.
The reality shows and competitions So You Think You Can Dance, America's Best Dance Crew, and Dancing with the Stars, have broadened the audience for dance.
