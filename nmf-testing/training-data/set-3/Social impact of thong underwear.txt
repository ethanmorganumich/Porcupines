Social impact of thong underwear
||||||
The social impact of thong underwear has been covered extensively in the media, ranging from bans on wearing thongs to thongs for children. The rise of thong usage has been asserted by Christian minister Oneil McQuick to be linked to a rise of sexualization in society, and by Christian writer Philo Thelos to be linked to a rise in the desire to go unclothed.
