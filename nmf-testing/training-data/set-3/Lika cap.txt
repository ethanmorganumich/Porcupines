The Lika cap (Serbo-Croatian: Lička kapa), also known as kićanka ("tassel") or crvenkapa (lit. "red cap"), is an important cultural symbol of the Lika region in Croatia, part of the Lika national costume traditionally worn by local Croats and Serbs. It is cylinder-shaped, with a flat top in a red colour, black sides, and often with a black tassel in the back.
