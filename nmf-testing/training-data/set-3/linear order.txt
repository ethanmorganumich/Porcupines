Total order

In mathematics, a total or linear order is a partial order in which any two elements are comparable.  That is, a total order is a binary relation 
  
    
      
        ≤
      
    
    {\displaystyle \leq }
   on some set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  , which satisfies the following for all 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b}
   and 
  
    
      
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle c}
   in 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
  :

  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq a}
   (reflexive).
If 
  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq b}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
        ≤
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\leq c}
   then 
  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        c
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq c}
   (transitive).
If 
  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq b}
   and 
  
    
      
        b
        ≤
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\leq a}
   then 
  
    
      
        a
        =
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a=b}
   (antisymmetric).

  
    
      
        a
        ≤
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\leq b}
   or 
  
    
      
        b
        ≤
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle b\leq a}
   (strongly connected, formerly called total).Total orders are sometimes also called simple, connex, or full orders.A set equipped with a total order is a totally ordered set; the terms simply ordered set, linearly ordered set, and loset are also used. The term chain is sometimes defined as a synonym of totally ordered set, but refers generally to some sort of totally ordered subsets of a given partially ordered set.
An extension of a given partial order to a total order is called a linear extension of that partial order.
