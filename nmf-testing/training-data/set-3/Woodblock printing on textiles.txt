Woodblock printing on textiles
||||||
Woodblock printing on textiles is the process of printing patterns on textiles, usually of linen, cotton or silk, by means of incised wooden blocks.  It is the earliest and slowest of all methods of textile printing.  Block printing by hand is a slow process. It is however, capable of yielding highly artistic results, some of which are unobtainable by any other method.
