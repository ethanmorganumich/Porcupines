Boss of the Plains
||||||
The Boss of the Plains  was a lightweight all-weather hat designed in 1865 by John B. Stetson for the demands of the American West.  It was intended to be durable, waterproof and elegant. This design and the term "Stetson" eventually became all-but-interchangeable with what later became known as the cowboy hat.
