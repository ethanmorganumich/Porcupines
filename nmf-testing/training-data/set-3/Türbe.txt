Türbe is the Turkish word for "tomb". In Istanbul it is often used to refer to the mausolea of the Ottoman sultans and other nobles and notables.
The word is derived from the Arabic تُرْبَة turbah (meaning "soil/ground/earth"), which can also mean a mausoleum, but more often a funerary complex, or a plot in a cemetery.
