Jerkin
||||||
A jerkin is a man's short close-fitting jacket, made usually of light-coloured leather, and often without sleeves, worn over the doublet in the 16th and 17th centuries.  The term is also applied to a similar sleeveless garment worn by the British Army in the 20th century.
A buff jerkin is an oiled oxhide jerkin, as worn by soldiers.
The origin of the word is unknown. The Dutch word jurk, a dress, often taken as the source, is modern, and represents neither the sound nor the sense of the English word.
