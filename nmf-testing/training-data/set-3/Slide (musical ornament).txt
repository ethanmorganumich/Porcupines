Slide (musical ornament)
||||||
The slide (Schleifer in German, Coulé in French, Superjectio in Latin) is a musical ornament often found in baroque musical works, but used during many different periods. It instructs the performer to begin two or three scale steps below the marked note and "slide" upward—that is, move stepwise diatonically between the initial and final notes. Though less frequently found, the slide can also be performed in a descending fashion.
