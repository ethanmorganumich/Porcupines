Rugby socks
||||||
Rugby socks are similar to the long socks that are worn in other sports such as association football. They are intended to be worn pulled up just below the knee and cover the shins and calves and are designed to be hardwearing. The knee-high socks for rugby were designed to fit tightly around their calves and feet. The proper fitting is an important requirement that ensures players will not fall down when playing, and moreover, it should assist in preventing blisters.
