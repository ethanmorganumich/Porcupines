Architecture of Jordan

The architecture of Jordan has been subject to vast development, specifically in the final years of the twentieth century. Jordan is a   semi-arid country located in the Middle East. Its location has great significance to Christians, Muslims and Jews as it is considered part of the Holy Land.The traditional architecture in Jordan can be attributed to many factors, which have played a pivotal role in shaping Jordanian culture. These factors include the different groups of people who have lived in the land, the mostly arid desert climate and the terrain, which is dominated by the Jordan River Valley, the Dead Sea, and the Jordanian Highlands. As a result of increased urbanisation and an open approach to global architectural trends, Jordanian architecture began to neutralise the traditional forms of architecture that dominated the region.
