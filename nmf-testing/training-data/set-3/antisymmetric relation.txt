Antisymmetric relation

In mathematics, a binary relation 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   on a set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   is antisymmetric if there is no pair of distinct elements of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   each of which is related by 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   to the other. More formally, 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   is antisymmetric precisely if for all 
  
    
      
        a
        ,
        b
        ∈
        X
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle a,b\in X,}
  

or equivalently,

The definition of antisymmetry says nothing about whether 
  
    
      
        a
        R
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle aRa}
   actually holds or not for any 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  . An antisymmetric relation 
  
    
      
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle R}
   on a set 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   may be reflexive (that is, 
  
    
      
        a
        R
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle aRa}
   for all 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in X}
  ), irreflexive (that is, 
  
    
      
        a
        R
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle aRa}
   for no 
  
    
      
        a
        ∈
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle a\in X}
  ), or neither reflexive nor irreflexive. A relation is asymmetric if and only if it is both antisymmetric and irreflexive.
