For human communication, LogoVisual thinking (also LogoVisual technology and LVT) is a practical methodology and tool that helps people think.
It is used by management teams, project leaders, teachers and students as a means of tapping the diversity of groups and enabling many people to participate in effective thinking processes.
It makes thinking visible and tactile by making ideas into moveable objects displayed on writeable surfaces â€“ for instance magnetic dry-wipe shapes on whiteboards.  Structured processes guide people's thinking to achieve their intended outcomes.
It can be used to help facilitate group discussions, and for helping people to find solutions for problems.
Sometimes people have called such meetings "brain storming sessions".
