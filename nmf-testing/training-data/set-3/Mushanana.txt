Mushanana
||||||
The umushanana (plural: imishanana) is the traditional ceremonial dress of women in Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda.  It consists of a wrapped skirt bunched at the hips and a sash draped over one shoulder, typically worn over a tank top or bustier. The fabric used for the mushanana may be any color and is often gauzy and lightweight to create a flowing effect. Mushananas are no longer frequently used as daily wear, but rather are worn on formal occasions such as to attend church services, weddings or funerals. They are standard costumes for female dancers in umushagirirodance troupes.

Mushanana is also worn by the Bafumbira women from Kisoro
District in the Kigezi sub-region in the western part of  Uganda.
