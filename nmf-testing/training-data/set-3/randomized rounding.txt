Within computer science and operations research,
many combinatorial optimization problems are computationally intractable to solve exactly (to optimality).
Many such problems do admit fast (polynomial time) approximation algorithmsâ€”that is, algorithms that are guaranteed to return an approximately optimal solution given any input.
Randomized rounding
(Raghavan & Tompson 1987)
is a widely used approach for designing and analyzing such approximation algorithms.  
The basic idea is to use the probabilistic method
to convert an optimal solution of a relaxation
of the problem into an approximately optimal solution to the original problem.
