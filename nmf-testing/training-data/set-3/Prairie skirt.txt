Prairie dress
||||||
A prairie dress or prairie skirt is a modest American style of skirt, an article of women's and girls' clothing.
Prairie dresses may be straight to slightly flared to very full, and may have one or more flounces (deep ruffles) or tiers;  prairie dresses may be worn over a ruffled eyelet or lace-trimmed petticoat. Traditionally, prairie dresses have long sleeves. In keeping with their design inspiration, traditional prairie skirts are usually made of "country" fabrics such as denim and flowered calico, though they can be of a solid colour too. Prairie skirts are a staple of women's western wear, and very full prairie skirts are worn for square dancing. Prairie dresses are often worn by women who attend Christian churches that emphasize the practice of plain dress (as with the Bruderhof Communities) or the doctrine of outward holiness (as with the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection). They are seen as fashionable, especially in cold weather.Prairie dresses earned their name for people travelling to the Western parts of the United States, though they were once "worn by women of all classes all over the country."
