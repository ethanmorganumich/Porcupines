Moghol people
||||||
The Moghols (Mogul, Mongul) are Mongolic people as descendants of the Mongol Empire's soldiers in Afghanistan. They live in the Kundur and Karez-i-Mulla villages of Herat province and speak the Moghol language. The Moghols sometimes call themselves "Shahjahan", because they joined the army of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Previously, Moghol villages could be found in Ghor, throughout the Hazarajat, and as far east as Badakhshan.
