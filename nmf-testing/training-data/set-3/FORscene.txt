Blackbird (software)
||||||
Blackbird (formerly named FORscene) is an integrated internet video platform, video editing software, covering non-linear editing and publishing for broadcast, web and mobile.
Designed by Blackbird plc to allow collaborative editing of video at resolutions of up to 540p and up to 60 frames per second on bandwidths as low as 2MBit/s, it is capable of video logging, reviewing, publishing and hosting through HD and 4K to UHD quality from original sources. The system is implemented as a mobile app for Android and iOS devices, a Java applet and a pure JavaScript web application as part of its user interface. The latter runs on platforms without application installation, codec installation, or machine configuration and has Web 2.0 features.
Blackbird won the Royal Television Society's award for Technology in the post-production process in December 2005.
