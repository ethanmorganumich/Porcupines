Signal-to-noise ratio
||||||
Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR or S/N) is a measure used in science and engineering that compares the level of a desired signal to the level of background noise. SNR is defined as the ratio of signal power to the noise power, often expressed in decibels. A ratio higher than 1:1 (greater than 0 dB) indicates more signal than noise.
SNR, bandwidth, and channel capacity of a communication channel are connected by the Shannonâ€“Hartley theorem.
