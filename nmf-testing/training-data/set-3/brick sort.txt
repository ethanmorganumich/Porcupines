Odd–even sort
||||||
In computing, an odd–even sort or odd–even transposition sort (also known as brick sort or parity sort) is a relatively simple sorting algorithm, developed originally for use on parallel processors with local interconnections.  It is a comparison sort related to bubble sort, with which it shares many characteristics.  It functions by comparing all odd/even indexed pairs of adjacent elements in the list and, if a pair is in the wrong order (the first is larger than the second) the elements are switched.  The next step repeats this for even/odd indexed pairs (of adjacent elements). Then it alternates between odd/even and even/odd steps until the list is sorted.
