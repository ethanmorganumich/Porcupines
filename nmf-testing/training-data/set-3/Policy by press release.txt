Policy by press release
||||||
Policy by press release refers to the act of attempting to influence public policy by press releases intended to alarm the public into demanding action from their elected officials. In modern times, the term is used to dismiss an opponent's claims by suggesting the arguments to be lacking in substance and created solely to generate media attention.
