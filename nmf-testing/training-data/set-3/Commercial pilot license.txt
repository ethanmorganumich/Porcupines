A commercial pilot licence (CPL) is a type of pilot licence that permits the holder to act as a pilot of an aircraft and be paid for their work.Different licenses are issued for the major aircraft categories: airplanes, airships, balloons, gliders, gyroplanes and helicopters. Depending on the jurisdiction these may all be on the same document.A CPL will typically have no expiry date. However, a valid medical certificate and valid rating will be required to use it. A pilot's ratings may be listed on the licence, including the types of aircraft that can be flown (single-engine or multiengine), whether flight under instrument flight rules is allowed (instrument rating), and whether instructing and examining of trainee pilots can be done (instructor or examiner rating).
