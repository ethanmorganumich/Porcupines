Flèche faîtière
||||||
A flèche faîtière is a carved rooftop spear or spire or finial that adorns Kanak houses, particularly the Great Houses of the Kanak Chiefs, in New Caledonia. The ceremonial carving is the home of ancestral spirits and is characterized by three major components.  The ancestor is symbolized by a flat, crowned face in the centre of the spear.  The ancestor's voice is symbolized by a long, rounded pole that is run through by conch shells.  The symbolic connection of the clan, through the chief, is a base, which is planted into the case's central pole.  Sharply pointed wood pieces fan out from either end of the central area, symbolically preventing bad spirits from being able to reach the ancestor. It evokes, beyond a particular ancestor, the community of ancestors. The flèche faîtière was depicted on a 2007 New Caledonian stamp.
