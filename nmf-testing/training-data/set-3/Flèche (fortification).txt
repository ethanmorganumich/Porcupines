Flèche (fortification)
||||||
A flèche (Fr. for "arrow") is an outwork consisting of two converging faces with a parapet and an open gorge, forming an arrowhead shape facing the enemy.The flèche is similar in plan to other defensive works like the ravelin (or demi-lune), but smaller and built in front of the glacis. It was thus part of the outworks of a fortress. It was usually placed in front of the point of a bastion in order to create an additional level of fire.
