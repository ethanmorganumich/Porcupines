Art Nouveau in Alcoy, (Spanish: modernismo en Alcoy, Valencian: modernisme en Alcoi), as one of the main focuses of the Valencian Art Nouveau, is the historiographic denomination given to an art and literature movement associated with the Art Nouveau in Alcoy (Alicante), Valencian Community, in Spain.
Its main form of expression was in architecture, but many other arts were involved (painting, sculpture, etc.), and especially the design and the decorative arts (cabinetmaking, carpentry, forged iron, ceramic tiles, ceramics, etc.), which were particularly important, especially in their role as support to architecture.
Although Art Nouveau was part of a general trend that emerged in Europe around the turn of the 20th century, in Alcoy the trend acquired its own unique personality in the context of spectacular urban and industrial development. It is equivalent to a number of other fin de siècle art movements going by the names of Art Nouveau in France and Belgium, Jugendstil in Germany, Sezession in Austria-Hungary, Liberty style in Italy and Modern or Glasgow Style in Scotland.
The Art Nouveau was active in Alcoy from roughly 1899 (art nouveau reform of the Glorieta Park in Alcoy) to 1915. The Modernisme movement in Alcoy is best known for its architectural expression, especially in the works of the architects Vicente Pascual Pastor and Timoteo Briet Montaud, but was also significant in sculpture and painting. Notable art nouveau painters from Alcoy include Fernando Cabrera Cantó, Francisco Laporta Valor, Emilio Sala, Adolfo Morrió, Edmundo Jordá and José Mataix Monllor. A notable art nouveau sculptor from Alcoy was Lorenzo Ridaura Gosálbez.
In the year 2010 Alcoy was included in the Art Nouveau European Route, an association of local governments and non-governmental institutions for the international promotion and protection of Art Nouveau heritage.
