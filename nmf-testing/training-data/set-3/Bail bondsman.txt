Bail bondsman
||||||
A bail bondsman, bail bond agent or bond dealer is any person, agency or corporation that will act as a surety and pledge money or property as bail for the appearance of a defendant in court.
Bail bond agents are almost exclusively found in the United States. In most other countries, the practice of bail bonding is illegal. The industry is represented by various trade associations, with the Professional Bail Agents of the United States and the American Bail Coalition forming an umbrella group for bail agents and surety companies and the National Association of Fugitive Recovery Agents representing the bounty hunting industry. Organizations that represent the legal profession, including the American Bar Association and the National District Attorneys Association, oppose the practice of bond dealing, claiming that it discriminates against poor and middle-class defendants while doing nothing for public safety.
