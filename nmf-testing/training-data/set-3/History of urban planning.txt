The history of urban planning is a technical and political process concerned with the use of land and design of the urban environment, including air, water, and the infrastructure passing into and out of urban areas such as transportation and distribution networks.
The history of urban planning runs parallel to the history of the city, as planning is in evidence at some of the earliest known urban sites.
