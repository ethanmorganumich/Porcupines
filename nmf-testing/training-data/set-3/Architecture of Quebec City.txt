Architecture of Quebec City
||||||
The architecture of Quebec City is characterized by its being one of North America (north of Mexico)'s oldest cities, founded in 1608. The original French settlers in the area built in an architectural style similar to the French style.
Quebec City was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1985, and is the only remaining fortified city north of Mexico.

Quebec City has significant pieces of secular architecture, including hundreds of surviving heritage homes which have been built in the particular style of New France.  This style is an adaptation to the colder climes of Quebec of ancient 17th- and 18th-century house forms of Normandy and other traditional lands of the North of France.
Quebec City has always been a predominantly Roman Catholic city, with many Catholic churches, notably the Notre-Dame de Québec Cathedral, Notre-Dame-des-Victoires Church and the Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré in the nearby town of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré.
