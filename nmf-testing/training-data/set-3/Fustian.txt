Fustian
||||||
Fustian is a variety of heavy cloth woven from cotton, chiefly prepared for menswear.  It is also used figuratively to refer to pompous, inflated or pretentious writing or speech, from at least the time of Shakespeare. This literary use is because the cloth type was often used as padding, hence, the purposeless words are fustian.
