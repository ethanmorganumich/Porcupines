Space complexity

The space complexity of an algorithm or a computer program is the amount of memory space required to solve an instance of the computational problem as a function of characteristics of the input. It is the memory required by an algorithm until it executes completely.Similar to time complexity, space complexity is often expressed asymptotically in big O notation, such as 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        n
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n),}
  

  
    
      
        O
        (
        n
        log
        ⁡
        n
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n\log n),}
   
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          n
          
            α
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(n^{\alpha }),}
   
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle O(2^{n}),}
   etc., where n is a characteristic of the input influencing space complexity.
