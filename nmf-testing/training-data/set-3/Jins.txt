A jins (Arabic: جنس / ALA-LC: jins, pl. أجناس / ajnās), in traditional Arabic music theory, is a set of three, four, or five stepwise pitches used to build an Arabic maqam, or melodic mode. They correspond to the English terms trichord, tetrachord, and pentachord. A maqam is made up of two or more ajnas.
