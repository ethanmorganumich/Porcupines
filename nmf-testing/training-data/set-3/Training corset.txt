Training corset
||||||
A training corset is generally a corset used in body modification.  A training corset may be used for orthopedic reasons (such as to correct a crooked spine) or for cosmetic reasons (to achieve a smaller waistline, commonly called waist training or in more extreme cases tightlacing.)
In addition, the term "training corset" may  refer to a corset which is used to acclimate the body prior to wearing a full corset as an everyday undergarment, or to any corset worn by somebody undertaking training (achieving a desired body shape).
