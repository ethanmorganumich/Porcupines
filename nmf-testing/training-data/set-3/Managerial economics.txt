Managerial economics is a branch of economics involving the application of economic methods in the managerial decision-making process. Economics is the study of the production, distribution and consumption of goods and services. Managerial economics involves the use of economic theories and principles to make decisions regarding the allocation of scarce resources.Managers use economic frameworks in order to optimise profits, resource allocation and the overall output of the firm, whilst improving efficiency and minimising unproductive activities. These frameworks assist organisations to make rational, progressive decisions, by analysing practical problems at both micro and macroeconomic levels. Managerial decisions involve forecasting (making decisions about the future), which involve levels of risk and uncertainty, however, the assistance of managerial economic techniques aid in informing managers in these decisions.The two main purposes of managerial economics are:

To optimize decision making when the firm is faced with problems or obstacles, with the consideration and application of macro and microeconomic theories and principles.
To analyze the possible effects and implications of both short and long-term planning decisions on the revenue and profitability of the Business.The core principles that managerial economist use to achieve the above purposes are:

monitoring operations management and performance,
target or goal setting, and
talent management and development.In order to optimize economic decisions, the use of operations research, mathematical programming, strategic decision making, game theory and other computational methods are often involved. The methods listed above are typically used for making quantitate decisions by data analysis techniques.
The theory of Managerial Economics includes a focus on; incentives, business organization, biases, advertising, innovation, uncertainty, pricing, analytics, and competition. In other words, managerial economics is a combination of economics and managerial theory. It helps the manager in decision-making and acts as a link between practice and theory.
