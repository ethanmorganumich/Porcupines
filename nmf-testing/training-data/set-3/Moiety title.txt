Moiety title
||||||
In law, a moiety title is the ownership of part of a property. The word derives from Old French moiti√©, "half" (the word has the same meaning in modern French), from Latin medietas ("middle"), from medius.In English law, it relates to parsing aspects of ownership and liability in all forms of property.In the Australian system of land title, it typically applies to maisonettes or attached cottages whereby the owner owns a share of the total land on the title and leases a certain portion of the land back for themselves from the other owner(s). Some finance institutions do not offer loans for properties on moiety titles as security.
