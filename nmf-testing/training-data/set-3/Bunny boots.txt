Bunny boots or Mickey Mouse boots (depending on the version) are the most common nicknames for the Extreme Cold Vapor Barrier Boots (Types I and II) used by the United States Armed Forces. These large, bulbous, waterproof rubber boots can be worn in extremely cold weather, −20 to −60 °F (−29 to −51 °C), with the liner-free interior retaining warmth by sandwiching up to one inch of wool and felt insulation between two vacuum-tight layers of rubber; this vacuum layer insulates the wearer's feet similar to a vacuum flask. These boots were originally developed at the Navy Clothing and Textile Research Center in Natick, Massachusetts, for use during the Korean War.

Originally designed during the Korean War for military expeditions in extremely cold weather (presently defined by the National Weather Service as −35 °F (−37 °C)), the ECVB Boots are rated to either -20°F to -60°F (depending on the type) and have been sold to civilians in large numbers as military surplus.
Owing to their warmth and low price, these boots have become staple extreme cold weather gear both in civilian work and recreational environments. Bunny boots are common in arctic climates such as Alaska.The Original U.S. Army military bunny boots had leather uppers with double buckles, with felt lowers and hard leather soles that were very slippery on ice and snow. They came with felt boot liners.
