Drag (physics)~

Lift-induced drag
||||||
In aerodynamics, lift-induced drag, induced drag, vortex drag, or sometimes drag due to lift, is an aerodynamic drag force that occurs whenever a moving object redirects the airflow coming at it. This drag force occurs in airplanes due to wings or a lifting body redirecting air to cause lift and also in cars with airfoil wings that redirect air to cause a downforce. It is symbolized as 
  
    
      
        
          D
          
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle D_{\text{i}}}
  , and the lift-induced drag coefficient as 
  
    
      
        
          C
          
            D
            ,
            i
          
        
      
    
    {\textstyle C_{D,i}}
  .
For a constant amount of lift, induced drag can be reduced by increasing airspeed. A counter-intuitive effect of this is that, up to the speed-for-minimum-drag, aircraft need less power to fly faster. Induced drag is also reduced when the wingspan is higher, or for wings with wingtip devices.
