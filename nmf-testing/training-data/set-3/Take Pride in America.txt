Take Pride in America
||||||
Take Pride in America is a United States Department of the Interior partnership program that encourages individuals, civic groups, corporations and others to volunteer in caring for the public lands that it controls.  The program's recent stated goal has been to instill in U.S. citizens an active sense of ownership and responsibility for natural, cultural, and historic resources. The program has been pursued since 1985 with varying levels of commitment, depending on funding levels and the commitment of the Department of the Interior under different federal administrations. As of 2015, though the Take Pride in America Act is still used as the legal basis for certain Department of the Interior programs, the program is not being promoted.
