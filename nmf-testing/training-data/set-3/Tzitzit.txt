Tzitzit (Hebrew: צִיצִית‎ ṣīṣīṯ, [tsiˈtsit]; plural צִיצִיּוֹת‎ ṣīṣiyyōṯ, Ashkenazi: tzitzis; and Samaritan: ࠑࠉࠑࠉࠕ‎ ṣeṣet) are specially knotted ritual fringes, or tassels, worn in antiquity by Israelites and today by observant Jews and Samaritans. Tzitzit are usually attached to the four corners of the tallit gadol (prayer shawl), usually referred to simply as a tallit or tallis; and tallit katan (everyday undergarment).  Through synecdoche, a tallit katan may be referred to as tzitzit.
