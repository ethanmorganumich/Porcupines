Cactus garden

A cactarium or cactuario (from Latin, cactarium) is a garden dedicated to the planting of cacti. While they generally specialize in collecting cacti, they can also include other desert plants such as sabla, agaves or Crassulaceae, although this would better be termed "xeriscaping".
Cacti are succulent plants native to the American continent, typical of arid environments. They require dry conditions and therefore, in many countries, the collections are kept in greenhouses that protect from rain. Due to their low need for water, they are a sustainable landscaping option.Cactariums also tend to host plants from other botanical families, native to the desert regions of the world.
