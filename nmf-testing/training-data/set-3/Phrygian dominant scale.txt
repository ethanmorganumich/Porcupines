Phrygian dominant scale
||||||
In music, the Phrygian dominant scale is the fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale, the fifth being the dominant. Also called the persian scale, altered Phrygian scale, dominant flat 2 flat 6 (in jazz), the Freygish scale (also spelled Fraigish), harmonic dominant, or simply the fifth mode of the harmonic minor scale. It resembles the scale of the Phrygian mode but has a major third. In the Berklee method, it is known as the Mixolydian ♭9 ♭13 chord scale, a Mixolydian scale with a lowered 9th (2nd) and lowered 13th (6th), used in secondary dominant chord scales for V7/III and V7/VI.
Bebop jazz pianist Barry Harris added a note to the scale and describes it as: For ii V in F minor (G-7b5 C7b9), play down from the 7th of the Eb7 dominant scale (Mixolydian) to E the 3rd of C7”.  Harris nicknamed this eight tone scale “the minor’s five”. He considered it to be the ideal melodic trajectory to react from when improvising a line over ii V in minor. Being eight tones it has the advantage of placing the chord tones on the beats which enables a melody to reinforce the underlying harmony. It also eliminates the harsh augmented 2nd melodic interval found between the b6 and 7th tone 5th in a harmonic minor scale. Another advantage is that gives improvisers access to their often more familiar dominant scale (Mixolydian) vocabulary. Barry Harris further recognized that its descending form has an especially melodic quality rather than being played up from its root. Harris said he had noticed this ideal descending permutation being played many times by Charlie Parker on such tunes as “What Is This Thing Called Love?” with its G-7b5 C7b9 chords.
