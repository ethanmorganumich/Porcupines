Northern Arizona University (NAU) is a public research university based in Flagstaff, Arizona. It was founded in 1899 as the final public university established in the Arizona Territory, 13 years before Arizona was admitted as the 48th state.
NAU is one of the three universities governed by the Arizona Board of Regents and accredited by the Higher Learning Commission. As of fall 2022, 28,090 students were enrolled at NAU with 21,411 at the Flagstaff campus. The university is divided into seven academic colleges offering about 130 undergraduate degrees, 100 graduate programs, and various academic certificates. Students can take classes and conduct research in Flagstaff, online, and at more than 20 statewide locations, including the Phoenix Biomedical Campus.
The university is classified among "R2: Doctoral Universities â€“ High research activity" and ranked No. 183 in the National Science Foundation (NSF) national research rankings for fiscal year 2020. NAU's astronomy faculty co-discovered several astronomical bodies, such as Eris, Sedna, and are major participants in the search for the hypothetical Planet Nine, with the university being a primary institution of the Lowell Observatory. NAU is a federally designated Hispanic Serving Institution.
The NAU Lumberjacks compete in the NCAA Division I, primarily as part of the Big Sky Conference, and have won several national championships, notably in cross country running.
