Horticultural oil
||||||
Horticultural oils or narrow range oils are lightweight oils, either petroleum or vegetable based. They are used in both horticulture and agriculture, where they are applied as a dilute spray on plant surfaces to control insects and mites. They are also sometimes included in tank mixes as a surfactant.
The oils provide control by smothering the target pests, and are only effective if applied directly to the pest, and provide no residual controls.
Oils are generally considered suitable for 'organic pest control', with most oils permitted under the U.S. National Organic Program.
