Network analysis (electrical circuits)
||||||
A network, in the context of electrical engineering and electronics, is a collection of interconnected components.  Network analysis is the process of finding the voltages across, and the currents through, all network components.  There are many techniques for calculating these values.  However, for the most part, the techniques assume linear components.
Except where stated, the methods described in this article are applicable only to linear network analysis.
