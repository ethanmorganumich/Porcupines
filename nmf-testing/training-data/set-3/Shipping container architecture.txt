Shipping container architecture
||||||
Shipping container architecture is a form of architecture using steel intermodal containers (shipping containers) as the main structural element. It is also referred to as cargotecture, a portmanteau of cargo with architecture, or "arkitainer". This form of architecture is often intertwined with the tiny house movement, as well as the sustainable living movement.
The use of containers as a building material has grown in popularity in due to their strength, wide availability, and relatively low cost. Homes have also been built with containers because they are seen as more eco-friendly than traditional building materials such as brick and cement.
