Busy signal
||||||
A busy signal (or busy tone or engaged tone) in telephony is an audible call-progress tone or audible signal to the calling party that indicates failure to complete the requested connection of that particular telephone call.
The busy signal has become less common in the past few decades due to the prevalence of call waiting and voicemail.
