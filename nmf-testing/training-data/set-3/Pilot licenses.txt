Pilot licensing and certification
||||||
Pilot licensing or certification refers to permits for operating aircraft. Flight crew licences are regulated by ICAO Annex 1 and issued by the civil aviation authority of each country. CAAâ€™s have to establish that the holder has met a specific set of knowledge and experience before issuing the licence. The licence, with added ratings, allows a pilot to fly aircraft registered in the licence issuing state. 
The ICAO Annex 1 - Personnel Licensing acts as the international minimum standards for licensing, however states can deviate from these standards by notifying ICAO about the changes. This, for instance, is why there are certain differences regarding licensing between EASA in Europe and the FAA in the USA.
