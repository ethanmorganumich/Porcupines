Time-domain reflectometer
||||||
A time-domain reflectometer (TDR) is an electronic instrument used to determine the characteristics of electrical lines by observing reflected waveforms.
It can be used to characterize and locate faults in metallic cables (for example, twisted pair wire or coaxial cable).
It can also be used to locate discontinuities in a connector, printed circuit board, or any other electrical path.
