Riparian water rights
||||||
Riparian water rights (or simply riparian rights) is a system for allocating water among those who possess land along its path.  It has its origins in English common law.  Riparian water rights exist in many jurisdictions with a common law heritage, such as Canada, Australia, and states in the eastern United States.Common land ownership can be organized into a partition unit, a corporation consisting of the landowners on the shore that formally owns the water area and determines its use.
