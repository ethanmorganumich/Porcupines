Cleat (shoe)
||||||
Cleats or studs are protrusions on the sole of a shoe or on an external attachment to a shoe that provide additional traction on a soft or slippery surface. They can be conical or blade-like in shape and can be made of plastic, rubber or metal. The type worn depends on the environment of play: grass, ice, artificial turf, or other grounds.
In American English, the term "cleats" is used synecdochically to refer to shoes featuring such protrusions.
