A sampot (Khmer: សំពត់, Khmer pronunciation: [sɑmpɔt]), a long, rectangular cloth worn around the lower body, is a traditional dress in Cambodia.  It can be draped and folded in several different ways. The traditional dress is similar to the dhoti of Southern Asia. It is also worn in the neighboring countries of Laos and Thailand where it is known as pha nung (Thai: ผ้านุ่ง [pʰâː nûŋ]).
