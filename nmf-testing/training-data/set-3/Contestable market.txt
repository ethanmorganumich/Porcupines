Contestable market
||||||
In economics, the theory of contestable markets, associated primarily with its 1982 proponent William J. Baumol, held that there are markets served by a small number of firms that are nevertheless characterized by competitive equilibrium  (and therefore desirable welfare outcomes) because of the existence of potential short-term entrants.
