Sierpiński curves are a recursively defined sequence of continuous closed plane fractal curves discovered by Wacław Sierpiński, which in the limit

    {\displaystyle n\to \infty }
   completely fill the unit square: thus their limit curve, also called the Sierpiński curve, is an example of a space-filling curve.
Because the Sierpiński curve is space-filling, its Hausdorff dimension (in the limit
