Upanayana (Sanskrit: उपनयन upanayana) is a Brahmin educational sacrament, one of the traditional saṃskāras or rites of passage that marked the acceptance of a student by a preceptor, such as a guru or acharya, and an individual's initiation into a school in Brahminism. Some traditions consider the ceremony as a spiritual rebirth for the child or future dvija, twice born. It signifies the acquisition of the knowledge of God and the start of a new and disciplined life as a brahmachari.Its applicable only those who are in Brahmin, Kshatriya or Vaishya Varna according to Hinduism. According to the given community and region, it is also known by numerous terms such as janai or janea, poita/paita, logun/nagun, yagnopavita, bratabandha, bratopanayan, mekhal. The Upanayanam ceremony is arguably the most important rite for the Brahmin male, ensuring his rights and responsibilities as a Brahmin and signifying his advent into adulthood.The tradition is widely discussed in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism and varies regionally. The sacred thread or Yajnopavita (also referred to as Janeu, Jandhyam, Poonal, Munja, Yonya and Janivara) has become one of the most important identifiers of the Upanayana ceremony in contemporary times, however this was not always the case. Generally, this ceremony should be performed before the advent of adulthood.
An interesting fact hardly known is that Janeu was worn by Jains as well in olden days, both by Guru and also Laymen. How this tradition died amongst Jains is unknown. Details of this ritual can be found as Upanayan sanskar vidhi in the 'Achar Dinkar Granth' by Jain monk Acharya Vardhamansuri of 10th century CE.
Recently in 2021, a Jain temple was excavated in Halebidu, Karnataka where a Jain idol wearing a janeu was found. More recently, in the 1st week of November 2022, another Jain idol with a janeu was found in a ruined Jain Temple in Sirichelma Village, Adilabad district, Telangana. Based on the mudra, it is assumed to be an idol of Gautam swami, the primary disciple of 24th Jain Tirthankar Mahāvīra. Guru Gautam swami in this mudra is commonly seen in Shwetambar Jain temples.
