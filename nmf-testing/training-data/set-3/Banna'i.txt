Banna'i
||||||
In Iranian architecture, banna'i (Persian: بنائی, "builder's technique" in Persian) is an architectural decorative art in which glazed tiles are alternated with plain bricks to create geometric patterns over the surface of a wall or to spell out sacred names or pious phrases. This technique originated in Syria and Iraq in the 8th century, and matured in the Seljuq and Timurid era, as it spread to Iran, Anatolia and Central Asia.
If the brickwork design is in relief then it is referred to as hazarbaf (Persian: هزارباف, compound of hazar "thousand" and baf "weavings", referring to the woven appearance of the bricks).
