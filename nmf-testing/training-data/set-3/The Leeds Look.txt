The Leeds Look
||||||
The Leeds Look describes a modern architectural style using red brick and grey slate roofs used for public and commercial buildings in Leeds city centre. The first examples appeared in the 1980s with the goal of harmonising new buildings with older brick buildings surrounding them. The style is sufficiently widespread and recognisable that it forms a notable period in the Architecture of Leeds.
Leeds Civic Trust and the Leeds Society of Architects played a key role in the classification and discussion of the style. For example, their "The Leeds Look or Where is Architecture Going?" event in February 1990 documents that the term was widely understood among architects nationally as early as 1990.
