External sorting
||||||
External sorting is a class of sorting algorithms that can handle massive amounts of data. External sorting is required when the data being sorted do not fit into the main memory of a computing device (usually RAM) and instead they must reside in the slower external memory, usually a disk drive. Thus, external sorting algorithms are external memory algorithms and thus applicable in the external memory model of computation.
External sorting algorithms generally fall into two types, distribution sorting, which resembles quicksort, and external merge sort, which resembles merge sort. The latter typically uses a hybrid sort-merge strategy.  In the sorting phase, chunks of data small enough to fit in main memory are read, sorted, and written out to a temporary file.  In the merge phase, the sorted subfiles are combined into a single larger file.
