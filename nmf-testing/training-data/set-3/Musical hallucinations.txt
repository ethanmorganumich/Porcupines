Musical hallucinations
||||||
Musical hallucinations (also known as auditory hallucinations, auditory Charles Bonnet Syndrome, and Oliver Sacks' syndrome) describes a neurological disorder in which the patient will hallucinate songs, tunes, instruments and melodies. The source of these hallucinations are derived from underlying psychotic illness or hearing impairment. These hallucinations are often rare and are followed by mental decline. Majority of patients who have symptoms of musical hallucinations are older and have onset conditions predisposing them to the disease. While there is no set form of treatment, research has discovered medications and alternative therapies to be successful in alleviating the hallucinations.
