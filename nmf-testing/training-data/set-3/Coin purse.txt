Coin purse
||||||
A purse or pouch (from the Latin bursa, which in turn is from the Greek βύρσα, býrsa, oxhide), sometimes called coin purse for clarity, is a small money bag or pouch, made for carrying coins. In most Commonwealth countries it is known simply as a purse, while "purse" in the United States usually refers to a handbag. "Purse" can also be a synonym to bursary (which has the same origin), i.e. a monetary prize in a competition.
