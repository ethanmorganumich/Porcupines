search.ch is a search engine and web portal for Switzerland. It was founded in 1995  by Rudolf RÃ¤ber and Bernhard Seefeld as a regional search engine. In the following years many other services were added, such as a phonebook in 1999 and a free SMS service in 2000 (now reduced to only one free SMS per week).
The search technology is home grown. The user can restrict his search to regions of Switzerland, such as a canton or a city. The web crawler looks only at sites in the .ch and .li top-level domains and a number of automatically and manually updated list of Swiss websites on other domains. The index isv5 updated weekly.
