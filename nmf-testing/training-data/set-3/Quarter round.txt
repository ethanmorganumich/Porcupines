Quarter round
||||||
A quarter round is a convex molding whose cross section is a quarter circle. It is one form of ovolo.
A variation is a base shoe, a quarter of an ellipse.Most quarter round is of small gauge and relatively flexible.  It is typically used as a decorative build-up element in mantels and other architectural features, and at the lower edge of baseboard to hide any gaps between it and a floor.  Base shoe is used similarly in flooring applications.
Quarter round is produced in hardwood, softwood, engineered wood, and extruded plastic.
