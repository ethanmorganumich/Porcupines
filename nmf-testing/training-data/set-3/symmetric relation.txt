Symmetric relation
||||||
A symmetric relation is a type of binary relation. An example is the relation "is equal to", because if a = b is true then b = a is also true. Formally, a binary relation R over a set X is symmetric if:

  
    
      
        ∀
        a
        ,
        b
        ∈
        X
        (
        a
        R
        b
        ⇔
        b
        R
        a
        )
        ,
      
    
    {\displaystyle \forall a,b\in X(aRb\Leftrightarrow bRa),}
  where the notation 
  
    
      
        a
        R
        b
      
    
    {\displaystyle aRb}
   means that 
  
    
      
        (
        a
        ,
        b
        )
        ∈
        R
      
    
    {\displaystyle (a,b)\in R}
  .
If RT represents the converse of R, then R is symmetric if and only if R = RT.Symmetry, along with reflexivity and transitivity, are the three defining properties of an equivalence relation.
