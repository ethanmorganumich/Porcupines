Temple ring
||||||
A temple ring is an ornament that hangs from a headdress or in braids of hair in the front area at the side of the head â€“  i.e. near a person's anatomical temple.  Temple rings were part of Slavic, Scandinavian and others' medieval women's dress. Most were made of base metals such as copper alloys or iron, though silver and even gold were occasionally used. These were known as temple rings because they were worn on the head, near the temples of a woman or a girl.
