3DO Interactive Multiplayer
||||||
The 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, also referred to as the 3DO System or simply 3DO, is a home video game console developed by The 3DO Company. Conceived by entrepreneur and Electronic Arts founder Trip Hawkins, the 3DO was not a console manufactured by the company itself, but a series of specifications, originally designed by Dave Needle and R. J. Mical of New Technologies Group, that could be licensed by third parties. Panasonic produced the first models in 1993, and further renditions of the hardware were released in 1994 by GoldStar (now LG Electronics), and in 1995 by Sanyo.
The console received mixed to negative reviews, and despite having a highly promoted launch (including being named Time magazine's "1993 Product of the Year") and being a host of cutting-edge technologies, an oversaturated console market prevented the system from achieving success comparable to competing consoles from Sega and Sony. By 1996 3DO saw no market in places like NA and the EU. Then by mid 1997 the 3DO Opera hardware was sold to Samsung and 3DO M2 was in the works of being sold to Panasonic. Samsung would continue to sell the 3DO hardware until late 1998/early 1999 as South Korean exclusive hardware.
