Hidden Markov model
||||||
A hidden Markov model (HMM) is a statistical Markov model in which the system being modeled is assumed to be a Markov process — call it 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   — with unobservable ("hidden") states. As part of the definition, HMM requires that there be an observable process 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   whose outcomes are "influenced" by the outcomes of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   in a known way. Since 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   cannot be observed directly, the goal is to learn about 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   by observing 
  
    
      
        Y
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y.}
   HMM has an additional requirement that the outcome of 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   at time 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=t_{0}}
   must be "influenced" exclusively by the outcome of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   at 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=t_{0}}
   and that the outcomes of 
  
    
      
        X
      
    
    {\displaystyle X}
   and 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   at 
  
    
      
        t
        <
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle t<t_{0}}
   must not affect the outcome of 
  
    
      
        Y
      
    
    {\displaystyle Y}
   at 
  
    
      
        t
        =
        
          t
          
            0
          
        
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle t=t_{0}.}
  
Hidden Markov models are known for their applications to thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, physics, chemistry, economics, finance, signal processing, information theory, pattern recognition - such as speech [3], handwriting, gesture recognition, part-of-speech tagging, musical score following, partial discharges and bioinformatics.
