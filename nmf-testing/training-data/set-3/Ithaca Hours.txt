Ithaca Hours
||||||
The Ithaca HOUR is a local currency formerly used in Ithaca, New York and was one of the longest-running local currency systems, though it is now no longer in circulation.  It has inspired other similar systems in Madison, Wisconsin; Santa Barbara, California;
Corvallis, Oregon; and a proposed system in the Lehigh Valley, Pennsylvania.  One Ithaca HOUR is valued at US$10 and is generally recommended to be used as payment for one hour's work, although the rate is negotiable.
