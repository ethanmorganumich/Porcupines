Pineapple pit
||||||
A pineapple pit is a method of growing pineapples in colder climates. One of the earliest examples in Britain has been found by archaeologists at Heligan in Cornwall. The first pineapples known to have been grown in Europe were cultivated in the Netherlands. None were grown in England until about 1715.
