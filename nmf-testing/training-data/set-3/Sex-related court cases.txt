The United States Supreme Court and various U.S. state courts have decided several cases regarding pornography, sexual activity, and reproductive rights.  The trend has been one of courts striking down states' attempts to regulate sex.
The following is a list of noteworthy sex-related court cases in order by date.  (Note that in the legal sense, the term "sodomy" often applies not only to anal sex but also to oral sex and other sex acts.)
