Football boot
||||||
Football boots, called cleats or soccer shoes in North America, are an item of footwear worn when playing association football. Those designed for grass pitches have studs on the outsole to aid grip. From simple and humble beginnings football boots have come a long way and today find themselves subject to much research, development, sponsorship and marketing at the heart of a multi-national global industry. Modern "boots" are no longer truly boots in that they do not cover the ankle - like most other types of specialist athletic footwear, their basic design and appearance has converged with that of sneakers since the 1960s.
In addition to association football, they are often worn for rugby union and rugby league in preference to dedicated rugby boots by players in specific positions. Football boots are often worn for other sports that are played on grass surfaces, such as Lacrosse, hurling, shinty, quiddich and even tug of war.
