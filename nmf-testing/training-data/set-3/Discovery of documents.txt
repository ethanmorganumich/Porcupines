Discovery (law)
||||||
Discovery, in the law of common law jurisdictions, is a pre-trial procedure in a lawsuit in which each party, through the law of civil procedure, can obtain evidence from the other party or parties by means of discovery devices such as interrogatories, requests for production of documents, requests for admissions and depositions.  Discovery can be obtained from non-parties using subpoenas.  When a discovery request is objected to, the requesting party may seek the assistance of the court by filing a motion to compel discovery.
