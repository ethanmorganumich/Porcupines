Rectification (law)
||||||
Rectification is a remedy whereby a court orders a change in a written document to reflect what it ought to have said in the first place. It is an equitable remedy, and so the circumstances on which it can be applied are limited.
In the United States, the remedy is commonly referred to as reformation.
