Catholic school uniform
||||||
A Catholic school uniform in North America typically consists of a pleated and plaid skirt or jumper (a sleeveless dress), Mary Jane or saddle shoes, a button-down shirt, and a sweater for girls, while boys' uniforms consist of a button-down shirt, a necktie, and dark pants.  Actual school uniforms vary widely by location and individual school.
In contrast to most schools in the United States, almost all Catholic schools in that country have some form of dress code, and most of them (especially those with students in the lower grade levels) have a mandatory uniform policy.
In most Commonwealth countries, school uniforms (often similar to the "Catholic school uniform" type in the United States) are common in all types of schools, whether secular or not and regardless of religious denomination.
In most schools in Latin America, school uniforms are common and their design is often very similar to the Catholic school uniform type from the United States.
