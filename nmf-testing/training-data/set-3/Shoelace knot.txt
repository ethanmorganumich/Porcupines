Shoelace knot

The shoelace knot, or bow knot, is commonly used for tying shoelaces and bow ties.
The shoelace knot is a doubly slipped reef knot formed by joining the ends of whatever is being tied with a half hitch, folding each of the exposed ends into a loop (bight) and joining the loops with a second half hitch. The size of the loops and the length of the exposed ends are adjusted when the knot is tied. It has the stability of the reef knot but is significantly easier to untie, simply by pulling the ends away from the center of the knot.
The loops are sometimes referred to as "bunny ears", especially when the knot is taught to children.
