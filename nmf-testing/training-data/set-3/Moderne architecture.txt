Moderne architecture, also sometimes referred to as "Style Moderne" or simply "Moderne", describes certain styles of architecture
popular from 1925 through the 1940s.
It has expression in styles traditionally classified as Art Deco, Streamline Moderne, PWA/WPA Moderne referring to U.S. spending programs such as the Public Works Administration, and Late Moderne. Architectural historian Richard Guy Wilson characterized the style by the eclectic co-existence of "traditionalism and modernism". The Moderne style of architecture appears as a descriptor in documentation of many buildings listed by the United States of America's National Register of Historic Places.
