Queeruption
||||||
Queeruption (a compound of queer and eruption)  is an annual international queercore festival and gathering started in 1998 where alternative/radical/disenfranchised queers can exchange information, network, organize, inspire and get inspired, self-represent, and challenge mainstream society with do-it-yourself (DIY) ideas and ethics.     Shows featuring queer punk bands, performance artists, and other entertainment are put on at night, while workshops and demonstrations take place during the daytime.   Queeruption generally takes place in a different city in a different country every year. It has contributed to anarcho-queer (queer anarchist) movements. The groups that organize each event and even within the same city may have disagreements about how aspects should represent politics including queer safe spaces.From their 2003 announcement. "Queeruption is non-commercial! Queeruption is Do-it-Yourself! We draw no line between organisers and participants. We seek to provide a framework (space, co-ordination) which you can fill with your ideas. It will include workshops, music, demonstrations, film, art, performances, (sex) parties, picnics, games and any other activities your feel like trying! What is queeruption? What is queer culture? For expression and exploration of identity. Climbing over the artificial boundaries of sexuality, gender, nation, class! Against racism, capitalism, patriarchy and binary gender repression."
