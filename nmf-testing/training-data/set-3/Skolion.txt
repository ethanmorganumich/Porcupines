A skolion (from Ancient Greek: σκόλιον) (pl. skolia), also scolion (pl. scolia), was a song sung by invited guests at banquets in ancient Greece. Often extolling the virtues of the gods or heroic men, skolia were improvised to suit the occasion and accompanied by a lyre, which was handed about from singer to singer as the time for each scolion came around.  "Capping" verses were exchanged, "by varying, punning, riddling, or cleverly modifying" the previous contribution.
