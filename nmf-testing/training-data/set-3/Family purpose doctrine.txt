Family purpose doctrine
||||||
In common law in the United States, the family purpose doctrine is a rule that holds the owner of an automobile liable for damages to others while a member of the family is driving the vehicle, regardless of whether or not the owner gave permission.  The underlying theory is that the vehicle is owned for family purposes.
