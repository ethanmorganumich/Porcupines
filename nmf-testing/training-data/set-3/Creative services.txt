GuildsLike lawyers and accountants in the professional services sector, creative services firms sell a specialised technical service to satisfy the needs of companies that do not have this expertise themselves.
Creative services firms provide creative services to other companies or to the public: they 'do creativity' to order.
Typical business models revolve around selling the time of skilled professionals, either on a project-by-project basis or through a service level agreement, and providing services on an ongoing basis for a fixed monthly fee. In this sense they share much in common with professional services firms but there are also key differences:

Creative services firms tend not to be bound by requirements for professional accreditation
There are low barriers to entry for new startup businesses
