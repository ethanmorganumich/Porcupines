Tignon
||||||
A tignon (also spelled and pronounced tiyon) is a type of headcoveringâ€”a large piece of material tied or wrapped around the head to form a kind of turban that somewhat resembles the West African gele. It was worn by Creole women of African descent in Louisiana beginning in the Spanish colonial period, and continuing to a lesser extent to the present day.
