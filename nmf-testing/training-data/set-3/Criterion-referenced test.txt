Criterion-referenced test
||||||
A criterion-referenced test is a style of test which uses test scores to generate a statement about the behavior that can be expected of a person with that score.  Most tests and quizzes that are written by school teachers can be considered criterion-referenced tests.  In this case, the objective is simply to see whether the student has learned the material. Criterion-referenced assessment can be contrasted with norm-referenced assessment and ipsative assessment.
Criterion-referenced testing was a major focus of psychometric research in the 1970s.
