Damask
||||||
Damask (; Arabic: دمشق) is a reversible patterned fabric of silk, wool, linen, cotton or synthetic fibers, with a pattern formed by weaving. Damasks are woven with one warp yarn and one weft yarn, usually with the pattern in warp-faced satin weave and the ground in weft-faced or sateen weave. Twill damasks include a twill-woven ground or pattern.
