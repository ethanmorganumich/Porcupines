Protein music (DNA music or genetic music) is a musical technique where music is composed by converting protein sequences or genes to musical notes. It is a theoretical method made by JoÃ«l Sternheimer, who is a physicist, composer and mathematician.The first published references to protein music in the scientific literature are a paper co-authored by a member of The Shamen in 1996,
and a short correspondence by Hayashi and Munakata in Nature in 1984.
