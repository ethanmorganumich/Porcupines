The Hmong people (RPA: Hmoob, Nyiakeng Puachue: 𞄀𞄩𞄰‎, Pahawh Hmong: 𖬌𖬣𖬵, IPA: [m̥ɔ̃́]) are a sub-ethnic group of the Miao people who originated from Central China. The modern Hmongs presently reside in Southwest China (Guizhou, Yunnan, Sichuan, Chongqing, and Guangxi), as well as Vietnam, Laos, Thailand, and diasporic communities in Australia and the United States.
During the First and Second Indo-China Wars, France and the United States intervened in the Laotian Civil War by recruiting thousands of Hmong people to fight against forces from North and South Vietnam, which were stationed in Laos in accordance with their mission to support the communist Pathet Lao insurgents. The CIA operation is known as the Secret War.
