Cello da spalla
||||||
The violoncello da spalla, known informally as the cello da spalla,  is a small cello played braced against the shoulder.
The violoncello da spalla was designed to be played by violinists, who have limited experience playing instruments such as the viola da gamba or cello, which are held in a vertical position fixed between legs. The viola da spalla is held on the shoulder and chest, and is larger than the viola.There are also numerous instances of suites, serenades, divertimenti, and cassations that begin and/or end with marches.  If these marches were to get the players in or out, the bass lines could have been played on these instruments, as well as on procession cellos which are regular cellos with a tiny hole under the neck where the player can attach a hook and a strap.
