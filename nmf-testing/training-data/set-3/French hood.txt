French hood
||||||
The French hood is a type of woman's headgear that was popular in Western Europe in the 16th century.
The French hood is characterized by a rounded shape, contrasted with the angular "English" or gable hood. It is worn over a coif, and has a black veil attached to the back, which fully covers the hair. Unlike the more conservative gable hood, it displays the front part of the hair.
