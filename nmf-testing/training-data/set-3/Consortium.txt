A consortium (plural: consortia) is an association of two or more individuals, companies, organizations or governments (or any combination of these entities) with the objective of participating in a common activity or pooling their resources for achieving a common goal.
Consortium is a Latin word meaning "partnership", "association" or "society", and derives from consors ("shared in property"), itself from con- ("together") and sors ("fate").
