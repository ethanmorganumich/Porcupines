Aboyne dress
||||||
The aboyne dress is the name given to the prescribed attire for female dancers in the Scottish national dances, such as the Flora MacDonald's fancy, the Scottish lilt, and others.  Male dancers wear the kilt for these dances, the kilt being a male garment.  There are two versions of the aboyne dress in use.  Some consider the aboyne as quite suited to the graceful movements of the National dances.The Aboyne Highland Games, established in 1867, have stipulated this style of attire for female dancers since 1952 for both national and highland dances.
