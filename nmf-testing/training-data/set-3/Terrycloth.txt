Terrycloth, terry cloth, terry cotton, terry toweling, terry, terry towel, or simply toweling is a fabric woven with many protruding loops of thread which can absorb large amounts of water. It can be manufactured by weaving or knitting. Terrycloth is woven on special looms that have two beams of longitudinal warp through which the filler or weft is fired laterally. The first industrial production of terrycloth towels  was initiated by the English manufacturer Christy in 1850. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the word may derive from French tir√© 'drawn', past participle of tirer 'draw out'.
