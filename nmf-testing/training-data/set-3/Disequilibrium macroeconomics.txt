Disequilibrium macroeconomics
||||||
Disequilibrium macroeconomics is a tradition of research centered on the role of disequilibrium in economics. This approach is also known as  non-Walrasian theory, equilibrium with rationing, the non-market clearing approach, and non-t√¢tonnement theory. Early work in the area was done by Don Patinkin, Robert W. Clower, and Axel Leijonhufvud. Their work was formalized into general disequilibrium models, which were very influential in the 1970s. American economists had mostly abandoned these models by the late 1970s, but French economists continued work in the tradition and developed fixprice models.
