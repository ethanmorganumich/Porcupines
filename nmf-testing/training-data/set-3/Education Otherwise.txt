Education Otherwise
||||||
Education Otherwise (EO) is a registered charity based in England which aims to provide support and information for families whose children are being educated outside school. It is the largest charity organisation in the United Kingdom. The organisation derived its name from the (then current) 1944 Education Act (Section 36) which stated that parents are responsible for the education of their children, "either by regular attendance at school or otherwise." This clause has been retained in subsequent Education Acts and remains a clear acceptance of the parity and validity afforded an education otherwise than by schooling.
