Chittagonian language
||||||
Chittagonian (চাটগাঁইয়া saṭgãia or চিটাইঙ্গা siʈaiŋga) is an Indo-Aryan language spoken in parts of the Chittagong Division in Bangladesh. Its speakers identify with Bengali culture and the Bengali language, but Chittagonian and Bengali are not mutually intelligible. Chittagonian is considered to be a separate language by many linguists. It is mutually intelligible with Rohingya and to a lesser extent with Noakhailla. It is estimated (2009) that Chittagonian has 13–16 million speakers, principally in Bangladesh.
