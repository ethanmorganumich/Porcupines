A duet with the players playing separate instruments is generally referred to as a piano duo.Music written for piano four hands is usually printed so that left-hand pages contain only the part for the pianist sitting on the left, while right-hand pages contain only the part for the pianist sitting on the right. The upper part (right) is called primo while the lower part (left) is called secondo.
