Disability Determination Services
||||||
Disability Determination Services, commonly called DDS, are state agencies that are funded by the US federal government.
 Their purpose is to make disability findings for the Social Security Administration.
Applicants for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) file applications for disability benefits at local Social Security field offices.
If the application is accepted, it is sent to the DDS in the state that the applicant lives to have the claim of disability assessed.
The claim is either approved or denied at the DDS for disability qualification. The claim is then returned to the originating SSA office to finish its processing.
