Spanish garden
||||||
A traditional Spanish garden is a style of garden or designed landscape developed in historic Spain.  Especially in America, the term tends to be used of a garden design style with a formal arrangement that evokes, usually not very precisely, the sort of plan and planting developed in southern Spain, incorporating principles and elements from precedents in ancient Persian gardens, Roman gardens and Islamic gardens, and the great Moorish gardens (historically known as riyads) of the Al-Andalus era on the Iberian Peninsula. 
In other parts of Spain, public parks and large gardens have been more influenced by the Italian garden, French formal garden, and even the English landscape garden. Spain has a variety of climatic conditions, especially in altitude and rainfall, and modern Spanish gardens are very varied accordingly. Spanish urban housing has long had more apartments than small houses, and the small houses have traditionally lacked front garden, with not that much to the rear either, often just a paved patio with small beds by the walls, and space for plants in pots.  Until recently, "full" gardens were mostly found in the country or very large urban houses, but some modern suburban developments have gardens closer to those of northern Europe and North America.
