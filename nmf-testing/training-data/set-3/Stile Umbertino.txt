Stile Umbertino

The stile Umbertino is the name commonly given to a 19th-century style of Renaissance Revival architecture in Italy. It is a style which is typical of the eclecticism of late 19th century architecture and decorative arts in Europe. It is characterized by its eclecticism, because of the mix of decorative elements from the past.
It flourished during the reign of king Umberto I of Italy, after whom it was named, and it was most popular in Rome.
