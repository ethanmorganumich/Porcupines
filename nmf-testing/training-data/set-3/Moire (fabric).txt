Moire (fabric)
||||||
Moire ( or ), less often moir√©, is a textile with a wavy (watered) appearance produced mainly from silk, but also wool, cotton and rayon. The watered appearance is usually created by the finishing technique called calendering. Moire effects are also achieved by certain weaves, such as varying the tension in the warp and weft of the weave.  Silk treated in this way is sometimes called watered silk.
