A layette is a collection of clothing and accessories for a newborn child.  The term "layette set" is commonly used in the United States to refer to sets of baby clothes. In the 1920s, expectant mothers or their friends and relatives frequently knitted a matching layette set, consisting of a blanket, hat, sweater and booties. That tradition has continued to the present day.Traditionally, women would often hand-sew or knit their baby's clothes during their pregnancy. Today "layette" is often used to identify a baby clothing section of a store. The term can also be used for bedding, accessories, and baby care items.
