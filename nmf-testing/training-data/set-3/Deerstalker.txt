Deerstalker
||||||
A deerstalker is a type of cap that is typically worn in rural areas, often for hunting, especially deer stalking.  Because of the cap's popular association with the fictional detective Sherlock Holmes, it has become stereotypical headgear for a detective, especially in comical drawings or cartoons along with farcical plays and films.
