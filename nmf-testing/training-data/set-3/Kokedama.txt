Kokedama
||||||
Kokedama (苔玉, in English, literally "moss ball") is a ball of soil, covered with moss, on which an ornamental plant grows. The idea has its origins in Japan, where it is a combination of the nearai (根洗い literally "root wash," but meaning "no pot") bonsai and kusamono planting styles. Today, Kokedama is very popular in Japanese gardens.
