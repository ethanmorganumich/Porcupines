The Eisenhower jacket or "Ike" jacket, officially known as the Jacket, Field, Wool, Olive Drab, is a type of waist-length jacket developed for the U.S. Army during the later stages of World War II and named after Dwight D. Eisenhower. Intended to be worn on its own or as an insulating layer beneath the M-1943 Field Jacket and over the standard wool flannel shirt and wool sweater, it featured a pleated back, adjustable waist band, fly-front buttons, bellows chest pockets, slash side pockets, and shoulder straps. 
The Eisenhower jacket has currently been reinstated as an active uniform item for use on official duty, as part of the implementation of the new service dress in 2020 which resembles the Army service uniform of World War II. An official statement at the webpage for the "Program Executive Office Soldier" unit of the Army describes this item as a "Heritage Green Eisenhower (Ike) Jacket," as part of the new Army Green Service Uniform (AGSU) . The Army website also states: 

The Army Green Service Uniform (AGSU) is inspired and based off the uniform worn by America’s “Greatest Generation” as they won World War II. The reintroduction of this uniform is meant to inspire trust and confidence in our Soldiers’ professionalism and readiness. The AGSU provides a higher quality uniform with a longer service life than the previous service uniform. Fielding of the AGSU began in July 2020. All Soldiers are required to have an AGSU by Oct. 1, 2027; at that time, the Army Service Uniform (ASU) will become an optional, formal and ceremonial uniform.
