Feria
||||||
In the liturgy of the Catholic Church, a feria is a day of the week other than Sunday.In more recent official liturgical texts in English, the term weekday is used instead of feria.If the feast day of a saint falls on such a day, the liturgy celebrated may be that of the saint, not that of the feria (the weekday liturgy). Accordingly, in actual liturgical practice a feria or ferial day is "a weekday on which no special ecclesiastical feast is to be celebrated".
