School of Dance and Circus
||||||
The School of Dance and Circus (Swedish: Dans- och cirkushögskolan, DOCH) was, until 2014, a Swedish institution offering 
higher education in the fields of dance education, folk dance, dance, dance therapy, historical dance, choreography and contemporary circus. Since 1 January 2014 it has been a part of Stockholm University of the Arts, and the previous name is no longer used.  DOCH was founded as the Institute of Choreography (Koreografiska institutet) in 1963; in 1978 it was renamed the University College of Dance, “Danshögskolan”; in 2010 it became the University of Dance and Circus, "Dans och Cirkushögskolan" (DOCH). It operated under the Ministry of Education, and was fully funded by the government and therefore had no tuition fees for Swedish and EU citizens.
