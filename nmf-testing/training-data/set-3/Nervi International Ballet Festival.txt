Nervi International Ballet Festival (Festival internazionale del balletto di Nervi) held during summer in Nervi (now a quartiere of Genoa) from 1955 to 2004 was the first event entirely dedicated to dance in post-war Italy. Together with the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto it is considered the most significant event of the Italian dance scene.
