Dush-toh
||||||
A dush-toh, also spelled dush-too, dush-tooh, or dush-tuh,  is a customary Caddo hair ornament worn by girls and women during dances, particularly the Turkey Dance. Neighboring tribes, such as the Kickapoo and Delaware, have similar women's hair ornaments.
A dush-toh consists of an embellished, butterfly- or hourglass-shaped frame that is worn on the back of the head with ribbons that flow down the back, almost to the ground. They were made in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as into the present.
