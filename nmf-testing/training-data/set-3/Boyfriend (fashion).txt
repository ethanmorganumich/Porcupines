Boyfriend (fashion)
||||||
In fashion design, "boyfriend" is a style of women's clothing that draws heavily from corresponding men's garments. Boyfriend style clothes are designed to looser or boxier, and tend to be oversized - giving the appearance that one is wearing their boyfriend's clothing. The style can be traced back to the 1960s, when Marilyn Monroe wore boyfriend jeans - loose fitting jeans that would highly contrast her extremely feminine looks in favor of a masculine aesthetic. While the style continued to grow with women borrowing their boyfriends' clothes, modern boyfriend style clothes are often designed to look unisex and fit most women. As the trend continues to grow, many brands, such as Gap, Forever 21, H&M, and Urban Outfitters, begin to create boyfriend or men's-inspired fashion targeted at female consumers.
