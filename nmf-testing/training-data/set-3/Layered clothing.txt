Layered clothing
||||||
Layered clothing is a fashion technique that is utilized by dressing many garments that are worn on top of each other. Using more or fewer layers, or replacing one layer but not others, allows for flexible clothing to match the needs of each situation. Two thin layers can be warmer yet lighter than one thick layer, because the air trapped between layers serves as thermal insulation. 
Layered clothing is particularly helpful in cold climates, where clothing must transfer moisture, provide warmth, and protect from wind and rain. In a hot and dry climate, clothes have very different functional requirements: they must block the radiation from the sun and allow for sufficient air circulation.
Outdoor and sports wear manufacturers favor layered clothing because, among other reasons, it allows them to offer "technical" or "functional" clothes which are optimized for the particular demands of a specific sport or activity. Such clothes are often made of advanced synthetic materials or wool, and are not very expensive. The use of layered clothing allows the wearer to remove a layer as their activity intensifies and body temperature increases, or conversely, add a layer as they begin to cool down.
