New Politics is an independent socialist journal founded in 1961 and still published in the United States today. While it is inclusive of articles from a variety of left-of-center positions, the publication is historically associated with a "Neither Washington Nor Moscow!" Third Camp, democratic Marxist perspective, placing it typically to the left of the social democratic views in the journal Dissent.
