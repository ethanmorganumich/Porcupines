Jamming (dance)
||||||
Jamming in dance culture is a kind of informal show-off during a social dance party. Dancers clear a circle (jam circle or dance circle) and dancers or dance couples take turns showing their best tricks while the remaining dancers cheer the jammers on.  While some jam circles are staged, most form organically and spontaneously when the energy and mood is right.
