A kosovorotka (Russian: косоворо́тка, IPA: [kəsəvɐˈrotkə]), also known in the West as a Russian peasant shirt or Tolstoy shirt (tolstovka). The name comes from the Russian phrase kosoy vorot (косой ворот), meaning a “skewed collar”. It was worn by all peasants in Russia — men, women, and babies — in different styles for every-day and festive occasions.Easy to make from one sheet of fabric, this garment is traditional for Russians, Mordovins, Setos, Komi-Permyaks and other ethnic groups in Russia, as well as in some regions of Moldova.
