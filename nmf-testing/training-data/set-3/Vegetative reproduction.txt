Vegetative reproduction

Vegetative reproduction (also known as vegetative propagation, vegetative multiplication or cloning) is any form of asexual reproduction occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment or cutting of the parent plant or  specialized reproductive structures, which are sometimes called vegetative propagules.Many plants naturally reproduce this way, but it can also be induced artificially. Horticulturists have developed asexual propagation techniques that use vegetative propagules to replicate plants. Success rates and difficulty of propagation vary greatly.  Monocotyledons typically lack a vascular cambium, making them more challenging to propagate.
