Petticoat affair

The Petticoat Affair (also known as the Eaton Affair) was a political scandal involving members of President Andrew Jackson's Cabinet and their wives, from 1829 to 1831.  Led by Floride Calhoun, wife of Vice President John C. Calhoun, these women, dubbed the "Petticoats", socially ostracized Secretary of War John Eaton and his wife, Peggy Eaton, over disapproval of the circumstances surrounding the Eatons' marriage and what they deemed her failure to meet the "moral standards of a Cabinet Wife".
The Petticoat Affair rattled the entire Jackson Administration and eventually led to the resignation of all but one Cabinet member.  The ordeal facilitated Martin Van Buren's rise to the presidency and was in part responsible for Vice President Calhoun's transformation from a nationwide political figure with presidential aspirations into a sectional leader of the Southern United States.
