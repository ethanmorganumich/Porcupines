Wristbands are encircling strips worn on the wrist or lower forearm.  The term can be used to refer to a bracelet-like band, similar to that of a wristwatch, to the cuff or other part of a sleeve that covers the wrist, or decorative or functional bands worn on the wrist for many different reasons. Wristbands are often worn and used similarly to event passes such as lanyards to information or allow people entry to events. These wristbands are made from loops of plastic that are placed around the wrist and are used for identification purposes (demonstrating the wearer's authorization to be at a venue, for example).
Another type of wristband is the sweatband; usually made of a towel-like terrycloth material. These are usually used to wipe sweat from the forehead during sport but have been known to be used as a badge or fashion statement. A practice common in mid-1980s punk subculture was to cut the top off of a sock and fashion the elastic into this type of wristband.
