World's Smallest Political Quiz
||||||
The World's Smallest Political Quiz is a ten question educational quiz, designed primarily to be more accurate than the one-dimensional "left–right" or "liberal–conservative" political spectrum by providing a two-dimensional representation. The Quiz is composed of two parts: a diagram of a political map; and a series of 10 short questions designed to help viewers quickly score themselves and others on that map.
The 10 questions are divided into two groups, economic and personal, of five questions each. The answers to the questions can be Agree, Maybe or Disagree. Twenty points are given for an Agree, ten points for a Maybe, and zero for Disagree. The scores are added for each group and can be zero to one hundred. These two numbers are then plotted on the diamond-shaped chart and the result displays the political group that agrees most with the quiz taker. The map consists of two dimensions: Progressive – Moderate – Conservative and Libertarian – Moderate – Authoritarian. Those who score 100 are plotted in the top as Libertarian, those scoring a 0 are plotted on the bottom as Authoritarian, those who score 100 at personal, and 0 at economic are placed as Progressive to the left, and vice versa if someone scores 0 at personal and 100 at economic they are placed at the right as conservative. A score of 50 of both places the quiz-taker in the middle as Moderate. The edges for Moderate goes at between 35 and 65 on each scale. 
The quiz was designed primarily for an American audience designed by the non-partisan libertarian organization Advocates for Self Government and published on a web page of that organization. The quiz was created by Marshall Fritz, and associates the quiz-taker with one of five categories: libertarian, left-liberal, centrist, right-conservative, or statist.
