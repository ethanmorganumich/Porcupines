Samba de Gafieira
||||||
Samba de Gafieira (also called Gafieira) is a partner dance to various Brazilian samba musical rhythms. Unlike street and club forms of Brazilian samba, it evolved as a ballroom dance (dança de salão, literally, "salon dance").Samba de Gafieira differs from the ballroom Samba, danced in International Latin and American Rhythm ballroom dance styles.
Gafieira is usually a pair dance, although in artistic performances it is not uncommon to add solo variations, including steps of Samba no Pé.
