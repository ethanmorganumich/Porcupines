Autodidacticism
||||||
Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education (also self-learning and self-teaching) is education without the guidance of masters  (such as teachers and professors) or institutions (such as schools). Generally, autodidacts are individuals who choose the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time. Autodidacts may or may not have formal education, and their study may be either a complement or an alternative to formal education. Many notable contributions have been made by autodidacts.
