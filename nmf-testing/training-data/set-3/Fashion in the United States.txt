Fashion in the United States
||||||
The United States is the leading country in the fashion design industry, followed by France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan. Apart from professional business attire, American fashion is eclectic and predominantly informal. While Americans' diverse cultural roots are reflected in their clothing, particularly those of recent immigrants, cowboy hats, boots, jeans, and leather motorcycle jackets are emblematic of specifically American styles.
New York City, and to a lesser extent Los Angeles, are the centers of America's fashion industry. They are considered leading fashion capitals. New York City is considered to be one of the "big four" global fashion capitals, along with Paris, Milan, and London.
