The Hanafi school (Arabic: حَنَفِية, romanized: Ḥanafiyah; also called Hanafite in English), Hanafism, or the Hanafi fiqh, is the oldest and one of the four traditional major Sunni schools (maddhab) of Islamic Law (Fiqh). It is named after the 8th century Kufan scholar, Abu Hanifa, a Tabi‘i of Persian origin whose legal views were preserved primarily by his two most important disciples, Imam Abu Yusuf and Muhammad al-Shaybani. It is considered one of the most widely accepted maddhab amongst Sunni Muslim community and is called the Madhhab of Jurists (maddhab ahl al-ray).The importance of this maddhab lies in the fact that it is not just a collection of rulings or sayings of Imam Abu Hanifa alone, but rather the rulings and sayings of the council of judges he established belong to it. It had a great excellence and advantage over the establishment of Sunni Islamic legal science. No one before Abu Hanifa preceded in such works. He was the first to solve the cases and organize them into chapters and was followed by Imam Malik ibn Anas in arranging Al-Muwatta. Since the Sahaba and the successors of the Sahaba did not put attention in establishing the science of Sharia or codifying it in chapters or organized books, but rather relied on the strength of their memorization for transmitting knowledge, Abu Hanifa feared that the next generation of muslim community would be misled, for not understaing Islamic Sharia science well. He began with Taharah (purification), then with Salat (prayer), then with other acts of Ibadah (worship), then Muwamalah (public treatment), then sealed the book with Mawarith (inheritance) which is what the jurists relied on him after his pass.Under the patronage of the Abbasids, the Hanafi school flourished in Iraq and spread throughout the Islamic world, firmly establishing itself in Muslim Spain, Greater Khorasan and Transoxiana by the 9th-century, where it acquired the support of every rulers including Ghaznavids, Delhi Sultanate, Kazakh Sultanate and the local Samanid rulers. Turkic expansion introduced the school to the Indian subcontinent and Anatolia, and it was adopted as the chief legal school of the Ottoman and Mughal Empire. In the modern Republic of Turkey, the Hanafi jurisprudence is enshrined in Diyanet, the directorate for religious affairs, through the constitution (art. 136).The Hanafi school is the maddhab with the largest number of adherents, followed by approximately one third of Sunni Muslims worldwide. It is mostly followed in Turkey, Pakistan, Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Egypt, the Balkans, the Levant, Central Asia, Morocco and Bangladesh, in addition to parts of Russia, China, and India. The other primary Sunni legal schools are the Maliki, Shafi`i and Hanbali schools.
