Morava architectural school (Serbian: Моравска школа архитeктуре/Moravska škola arhitekture), also known as the Morava style (Моравски стил/Moravski stil), or simply as the Morava school (Моравска школа/Moravska škola), is an ecclesiastical architectural style that flourished in the Serbian Late Middle Ages (ca. 1370–1459), during the reign of the Lazarević and Branković dynasties.  The churches and monasteries were built by the rulers Lazar Hrebeljanović (1370–1389), Stefan Lazarević (1402–1427) and Đurađ Branković (1427–1456) and their nobility. The first endowment was the royal tomb of Ravanica. The main achievement of the Morava School is the splendor of the sculptural elements. The decorative stone plastic of the Moravska School represents one of the most original artistic achievements of medieval Serbian art. Decorative elements characteristic of this artistic school typically consist of geometric arabesque with stylized floral ornaments and interlaces, which include only scarce figurative details. As fragments of the plastic decoration from the almost completely destroyed Church of Saint Steven in village Milentija testify, this sculpture was usually painted, and thus, very vivid in effect.
