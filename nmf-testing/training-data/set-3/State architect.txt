||||||
Many national governments and states have a public official titled the state architect or government architect.  The specific duties and areas of responsibility of state architects vary, but they generally involve responsibility for the design and/or construction of public buildings in the state.  The state architect and subordinates typically form an organizational unit variously named the Division of the State Architect, Office of the State Architect, or similar.
