Bermuda shorts
||||||
Bermuda shorts, also known as walk shorts or dress shorts, are a particular type of short trousers, worn as semi-casual attire by both men and women. The hem, which can be cuffed or un-cuffed, is around 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the knee.
They are so-named because of their popularity in Bermuda, a British Overseas Territory, where they are considered appropriate business attire for men when made of suit-like material and worn with knee-length socks, a dress shirt, tie, and blazer.
True Bermuda shorts are not to be confused with "capri pants" extending below the knee. Cargo shorts may be a similar length but are typically baggy or less "tailored" than Bermuda shorts and more typical of West Coast American fashion.
