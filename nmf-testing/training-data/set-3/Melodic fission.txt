Melodic fission
||||||
In music cognition, melodic fission (also known as melodic or auditory streaming, or stream segregation), is a  phenomenon in which one line of pitches (an auditory stream) is heard as two or more separate melodic lines.  This occurs when a phrase contains groups of pitches at two or more distinct registers or with two or more distinct timbres.
The term appears to stem from a 1973 paper by W. J. Dowling. In music analysis and, more specifically, in Schenkerian analysis, the phenomenon more often is termed compound melody.In psychophysics, auditory scene analysis is the process by which the brain separates and organizes sounds into perceptually distinct groups, known as auditory streams.
The counterpart to melodic fission is melodic fusion.
