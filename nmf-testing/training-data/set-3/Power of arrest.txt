Power of arrest
||||||
The power of arrest is a mandate given by a central authority that allows an individual to remove a criminal's (or suspected criminal's) liberty. The power of arrest can also be used to protect a person, or persons from harm or to protect damage to property.
However, in many countries, a person also has powers of arrest under citizen's arrest or any person arrest / breach of the peace arrest powers.
