Democratic education
||||||
Democratic education is a type of formal education that is organized democratically, so that students can manage their own learning and participate in the governance of their school.  Democratic education is often specifically emancipatory, with the students' voices being equal to the teacher's.The history of democratic education spans from at least the 17th century. While it is associated with a number of individuals, there has been no central figure, establishment, or nation that advocated democratic education. The term Democratic Education originated with The Democratic School of Hadera, which was founded in 1987 in Israel.
