A sweater vest (known as a tank top, sleeveless sweater or sleeveless pullover in the UK) is an item of knitwear that is similar to a sweater, but without sleeves, usually with a low-cut neckline. They were popular in the 20th century, particularly in the 1970s in the UK, and are again growing in popularity in this century.
