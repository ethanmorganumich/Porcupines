Orchestral enhancement
||||||
Orchestral enhancement is the technique of using orchestration techniques, architectural modifications, or electronic technologies to modify the sound, complexity, or color of a musical theatre, ballet or opera pit orchestra. Orchestral enhancements are used both to create new sounds and to add capabilities to existing orchestral ensembles.
Adding additional instruments to a pit orchestra is a long-practiced  technique used to obtain a fuller, richer sound. Starting in the 1970s, instruments in musical theatre were amplified with sound reinforcement systems. In the 1980s, the introduction of electronic synthesizers, sequencers and prerecorded music tracks was initially greeted with fear by musicians' unions and performers. However, rather than entirely replacing traditional orchestra pit instruments, these technologies are often used alongside the "live" violin players, wind instrumentalists, and rhythm section members.
