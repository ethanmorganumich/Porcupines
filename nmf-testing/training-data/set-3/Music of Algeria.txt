Music of Algeria
||||||
Algerian music is virtually synonymous with Ra√Ø among foreigners; the musical genre has achieved great popularity in France, Spain and other parts of Europe.  For several centuries, Algerian music was dominated by styles inherited from Al-Andalus, eventually forming a unique North African twist on these poetic forms. Algerian music came to include suites called nuubaat (singular nuuba).  Later derivatives include rabaab and hawzii.
