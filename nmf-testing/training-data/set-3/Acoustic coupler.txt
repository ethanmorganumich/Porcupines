Acoustic coupler
||||||
In telecommunications, an acoustic coupler is an interface device for coupling electrical signals by acoustical meansâ€”usually into and out of a telephone.
The link is achieved through converting electric signals from the phone line to sound and reconvert sound to electric signals needed for the end terminal, such as a teletypewriter, and back, rather than through direct electrical connection.
