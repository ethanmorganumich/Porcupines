Eurythmy is an expressive movement art originated by Rudolf Steiner in conjunction with his wife, Marie, in the early 20th century. Primarily a performance art, it is also used in education, especially in Waldorf schools, and – as part of anthroposophic medicine – for claimed therapeutic purposes.The word eurythmy stems from Greek roots meaning beautiful or harmonious rhythm. (“Eu” meaning “well”).
